            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To them that have heard Jeſus in his Goſpel, and know and believe that he is indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the World.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Chriſtian Reader, and beloved Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving in my Family, according to my weak ability, read over the Scriptures of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles which precede this Book of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;</hi> and coming at laſt unto this Book of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy: I had many thoughts ariſing in mine heart, whether I ſhould adventure to meddle with it, or undertake to read it, as I had done the former Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures written ſince the manifeſtation of Chriſt, or not. Manifold diſcouragements were ready at hand, and preſented themſelves to hinder me therefrom: As to ſay, 1. The appearing difficulty of the things therein contained. 2. Mine own childiſhneſs (not in age ſo much, as) in underſtanding the firſt and more fundamental things of the teſtimony of Jeſus, which is the Spirit of prophecy, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. and too too great carnality and fleſhly-mindedneſs; of both which I was a little made ſenſible, though too
<pb facs="tcp:48916:3"/>
much defective therein. 3. The ſtrange and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apprehenſions of thoſe very few learned Men, whoſe Writings I have, each to other, concerning the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt in this Book. 4. My great aloneneſs, and want of ſuch helps, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Lord, as with whom I might with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, comfort, and confidence have conferred; and by whom I might have been aſſiſted. Theſe, and ſuch like conſiderations, were before me, and had much impreſſion upon me; ſo as while I muſed on, and conſulted them ſimply, I was almoſt determined to make no entrance into the reading of this Book.</p>
            <p>But again, on the other hand, many arguments alſo contained even in the beginning of the Book it ſelf, did, ſome of them, encourage me to make ſome entrance into it; and however to conſider and read the three firſt Chapters, which appear more eaſy to be underſtood: and others in reading them, embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened me to make further progreſs thereinto; as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſome of them a little.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Title of the Book: It is called, <hi>[The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> &amp;c.] to import and ſignify, that it is not a ſealed Book now, but an opened, and revealed Book: Indeed, had it been like the words ſpoken unto <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 12. 4, 9. Or like to that Book before it was opened, ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4. Or like to what the ſeven Thunders uttered, <hi>Rev.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48916:3"/>
10. 4. It had been great ſawcineſs, and high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in me, to have intruded, or curiouſly pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into it: But it's Title is, <hi>The Revelation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. v. 1. <hi>and</hi> ch. 22. 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The conſideration whoſe this Book is, carries motive in it; to move us to look into it, <hi>viz.</hi> It is Jeſus Chriſt's, <hi>ch.</hi> 1. 1. one's who is an admirable lover of us. And it is his:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Given to him who is the Saviour, and upon whom the Spirit is put immeaſurably, for the good of all Men, and eſpecially of them that believe: Given to him by God the Father, when he was exalted in our nature to the right hand of God: who then gloriouſly received gifts in the Man, and for Men, <hi>&amp;c. Pſ.</hi> 68. 18. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 33.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And it was given unto him, to ſhew, <hi>viz.</hi> to bring forth into light, that it might be underſtood. Now this encouraged me to pray unto the Lord: And to call in ſome of my friends to joyn with me in praying unto him, and in his name, to reveal mine eyes to behold theſe wondrous things of his Law; Remembring what gracious promiſes he had confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his precious blood, and propounded in his Goſpel, to that end, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13, 14. <hi>and</hi> ch. 16. 23, 24.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The minding to whom he was to ſhew it, <hi>viz.</hi> unto his Servants, even to the Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:48916:4"/>
with ſome of which there were faults, and great ones alſo found, <hi>ch.</hi> 1. 1, 4, <hi>ii.</hi> and <hi>ch.</hi> 22. 6, 16. and the perſons called upon to hear and underſtand it, to wit, <hi>he that hath an ear;</hi> as at the cloſe of every of the ſeven Epiſtles to the ſeven Churches in <hi>ch.</hi> 2. and <hi>ch.</hi> 3. &amp;c. contributed ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mine undertaking to look into, and conſider this Book.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The perſon unto whom he ſent and ſignified it by his. Angel, <hi>viz. to his Servant,</hi> John, <hi>who bare witneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Rev. 1. 1, 2. one who was a Man ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to like paſſions with others, and an unlearned and ignorant Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> [ſee the notes on <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. v. 9.] This alſo was not unuſeful to me.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The bleſſedneſs pronounced indefinitely on him that readeth, and on them that hear, <hi>&amp;c. ch.</hi> 1. 3. without the excluſion of any who deſire to fear his name; put ſtrength and reſolution into me, to make ſome entrance into, and progreſs in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Book. And indeed, the whole Preface contains forcible and plentiful encouragements to ſearch diligently into this Book of prophecy; and ſuch as are not ordinarily, if ever, found in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Book, or Epiſtle, in the Bible, in the beginning thereof.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and ſuch-like conſiderations, moved me to wave my diſcouraging thoughts, and not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded
<pb facs="tcp:48916:4"/>
thereby; But to put my foot into thoſe waters, and wade therein, as God gave me opportunity, and ability.</p>
            <p>This I deſire of thee, that thou take no one thing I have ſaid on truſt from me, becauſe I have ſaid it: I have been harmed my ſelf by ſo doing from others; and oft ſeen cauſe to let go what I ſo receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and may ſtill further ſee cauſe ſo to do: Be warned by my harme; and read over and over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and weigh diligently with the Text, and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Chriſt, what thou readeſt: And what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to wholeſome words therein embrace, and hold faſt: and what diſſents therefrom reject: And what is doubtful let alone, till further light, or help be afforded. And the Lord give his bleſſing to what is conſonant to his word therein, and diſcover to me and deliver me from all my miſtakes and evils in heart and way: And make theſe Notes as profitable to thee, as they have been painful to me, I mean to my fleſh, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 12. I deſire to be,</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Future things, things not then come to paſs. This Book is not given to acquaint Chriſts Servants with what was done in and by Chriſt, though theſe things may be occaſionally mentioned, as Ch. 1. 18. and <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to ſhew things to be done in his Providence in the World, and Providential Government in, and about his Churches; and of their ſufferings, and the Judgments to be executed upon their Enemies; and Chriſts coming again; and making all things new, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is the ſubject-matter of this Book in general.

So the things here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed muſt be done and fulfilled; thoſe Judgments muſt be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; the Man of Sin revealed, come to his height, conſume and be deſtroyed: His people muſt through much tribulation, enter into the Kingdom of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>[Shortly]</hi> As with reſpect to God and to Eternity; ſo theſe things muſt be done ſhortly and quickly. Thus when the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> acquaints the Believers with, and exhorts them to know and take notice of this, <hi>That there ſhall come in the laſt days Scoffers, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their own luſts, and ſaying, where is the Promiſe of his coming?</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1, 3, 4. After the Apoſtle had declared their willing ignorance about God's Deſtruction of the Old World, <hi>&amp;c. ver.</hi> 5. 7. He then gives this caution and warning to the Believers, to the end they might not be led away with the errour of the Wicked, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>But Beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one Day with the Lord is as a thouſand Years, and a thouſand Year as one Day.</hi> One Day with him, is as long as a thouſand Years with us; and a thouſand Years as ſhort as one Day, for he inhabits Eternity. As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>The conſideration of this one thing doth hugely conduce to the Believers being preſerved from the errour of theſe Scoffers.</hi> For, ſay they, where is the promiſe of his coming? He hath promiſed to diſſolve all theſe things and to make all things new, new Heavens, and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs: And this he hath promiſed long ſince to do in a little time. Compare <hi>Hagg.</hi> 2. 6. with <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 26, 28. But notwithſtanding his promiſe, all things continue as they were; and therefore it is ridiculous to expect the accompliſhment and performance of his promiſe. But now, the knowing and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what [a little time] is with him that promiſed, <hi>viz.</hi> that a thouſand Years with him, are as one Day with us; and two thouſand as two, will greatly conduce to the preſerving us from their miſtakes, and help us to know, that though he be long-ſuffering, yet the Day of the Lord will come; and according to his promiſe, he will make new Heavens and a new Earth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>

                  <p>Now this account may be given to us, of what he bare witneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Book was ſhewed to him, to wit, <hi>Of the Word of God, &amp;c.</hi> Not only to ſhew the excellency of his exerciſe and ſervice, and wherein he was Chriſt's Servant, <hi>v.</hi> 1. and to declare unto us his faithfulneſs; but alſo to direct us, that before we may have the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of, and acquaintance with, the things contained in this Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhould firſt always give diligent heed unto, and heartily believe, and keep in believing remembrance, thoſe things he bare witneſs unto before theſe Viſions and Revelations of the Lord were vouchſafed to him. Namely, the firſt, great, and fundamental things of Gods Law and Doctrine, the word of the beginning of Chriſt, which is the Foundation of all gracious and Spiritual Operations, and of all Doctrines, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. they who are unacquainted with, or let ſlip thoſe firſt things, cannot underſtand theſe things which are myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, deep, and hard to be underſtood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 11, 14. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 1. 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How did he bear witneſs of the Word of God, and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus Chriſt, and of all things which he ſaw? He did bear witneſs thereof,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By his verbal preaching of theſe great things of God's Law; he did believe them with his Heart, and ſo ſet to his Seal that God is true in his Teſtimony of his Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 33. and did make Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them with his mouth to the Salvation of himſelf and others that heard him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8, 10. with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>He that ſaw theſe things bare record, and his record is true; and he knoweth that he ſaith true, that we might believe, Joh.</hi> 19. 35. Thus our Saviour, when raiſed from the Dead, after he had opened the Scriptures to his Diſciples, and opened their underſtanding that they might underſtand the Scriptures; he then informes them that they muſt be his witneſſes, to bear witneſs of the great Contents of the Goſpel<hi>:</hi> to wit, of Chriſt's Death and Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And how they muſt bear witneſs and record of theſe things, namely, by going into all the World, and preaching the Goſpel to every Creature of all the Nations. He ſaid unto them, <hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe from the</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:48916:10"/>
                     <hi>Dead the third day; and that Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins ſhould be preached in his name unto all Nations, beginning at</hi> Jeruſalem<hi>: And ye are witneſſes of theſe things, Luk.</hi> 24. 32, 44, 47, 48. with <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 15. And this preaching of the Croſs, though it be to them that periſh fooliſhneſs, yet it is an excellent way of witneſſing unto Chriſt, when it is without excellency of Speech or of Wiſdom. It is the Power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17, 18, 23, 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 15, 16. And by uſing and delivering the Ordinances of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>And he bare witneſs of the Word of God, &amp;c.</hi> by writing alſo, after the Holy Ghoſt was poured down from on high upon the Apoſtles; which is a bleſſed and ſanctified means for diſperſing the knowledge of theſe excellent things to ſuch as he was not perſonally withall; and for perpetuating them, and conveying them to ſuch as were then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, or uncapable of knowing them, as we may further ſee on <hi>Verſe</hi> 11. This way alſo, even by writing, <hi>He bare record: Theſe are written,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his name,</hi> Joh. 19. 35. with Chap. 20, 30, 31. <hi>This is the Diſciple which teſtifieth of theſe things, and wrote theſe things, and we know that his Teſtimony (both ways) is true,</hi> Joh. 21. 24. <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard, declare we unto you.—And theſe things write we unto you that your joy may be full,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 1, 3, 4. <hi>Theſe things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 13. with Chap. 4. 13. 14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And he bare witneſs of them by a patient enduring Afflictions and Perſecutions for the Word of Chriſt, as he ſaith in <hi>Verſe</hi> 9. <hi>I</hi> John <hi>who am—your Companion in Tribulation,—was in the Iſle which is called</hi> Patmos, <hi>for the word of God, and for the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He was a faithful Martyr, or witneſs, by partaking of, and taking patiently the Afflictions of the Goſpel. So <hi>Paul</hi> alſo bare witneſs of Chriſt and his Teſtimony, by a patient enduring the Perſecutions and Tribulations he met withal, both from the people and Gentiles; as is ſignified to us by what Chriſt ſaid to him<hi>:</hi> The Lord ſtood by him, and ſaid, <hi>Be of good chear,</hi> Paul, <hi>for as thou haſt teſtified of me at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſo muſt thou bear witneſs alſo at</hi> Rome, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 11. And herein <hi>John</hi> was an imitater of our Lord Jeſus, who witneſſed a good confeſſion before <hi>Pontius Pilate;</hi> and therein hath <hi>he left us an Example that we ſhould follow his ſteps,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20, 21, 23. Chriſt Jeſus was a faithful and true Martyr, in ſuffering for the Goſpel even unto Death. And this way alſo ſhould his Servants, after his Example,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48916:11"/>
bear witneſs of the Word of God, in not loving their lives unto the Death; as our Saviour ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>He that hateth his life, in this World ſhall keep it unto life eternal. If any man ſerve me let him follow me; let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs daily, and follow me:</hi> Or elſe he cannot be his Diſciple, nor faithfully and fully bear witneſs of his Teſtimony, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 24, 26. with <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 23, 24. and <hi>Ch.</hi> 14. 26, 27, 33.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48916:11"/>
taken in a more ſtrict, and proper acceptation, to wit, for prediction, or fore-telling, as plainly appears, in that this is ſignified to be a Book which doth fore-declare things which are future, and to come to paſs.

And therefore it is a great and hurtful miſtake, to apply a great part of the Propheſie of this Book to that which was over and paſt before this Revelation was ſent and ſignified to <hi>John,</hi> to wit, <hi>the Deſtruction of Jeruſalem:</hi> [See the notes after on <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>Ver.</hi> 13.] By which miſtake all the Propheſies contained herein are miſplaced and diſordered.</p>

                  <p>And ſeeing it is a Book of Propheſie, it appears to be the more hard to be underſtood: And therefore as we ſhould pray to God open our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, to behold theſe myſterious things of his Law; ſo ſhould we alſo apply our hearts to the Teſtimony of Jeſus, namely, <hi>to the Teſtimony of Jeſus</hi> of which <hi>John</hi> bare witneſs before he received this Book; <hi>For the Teſtimony of Jeſus is the Spirit of Propheſie, Rev.</hi> 19. 10. with <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. 2. this is the Object here intimately commended to us, <hi>[The words of this Propheſie.]</hi>

Hence when the Holy Ghoſt had been deſcribing the Glory of the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſhewing the pure River of the Water of Life, and Tree of Life; and aſſuring there ſhould be no more Curſe there, but the Throne of God, and of the Lamb, and his Servants ſhall ſerve him: <hi>And they ſhall ſee his face, and his name ſhall be in their fore-heads, &amp;c.</hi> He ſubjoyns thereto, <hi>Bleſsed is he that keepeth the ſayings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of this Book, Rev.</hi> 21. and <hi>ch.</hi> 22. 1, 6, 7, 14.

                  <p>2. We have nextly propounded to us, the reaſon of their bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs eſpecially: <hi>[For the time is at hand.]</hi> Now eſpecially they are bleſſed, becauſe of the nigh approaching of the things contained in this Book, to wit, comparatively to former times; becauſe <hi>the time is at hand, Rev.</hi> 22. 7, 10. That they may keep themſelves pure, and not be ſpotted with the ſpots that are not of his people: as he ſaith, <hi>Behold I come as a Thief,</hi> to wit, ſuddenly and unexpectedly; <hi>Bleſſed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his Garments, leſt he walk naked, and they ſee his ſhame, Rev.</hi> 16. 15. And becauſe there ſhall be a ſpeedy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the happineſs therein promiſed; that they might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged not to caſt away, but hold faſt their confidence and in patience poſſeſs their ſouls; <hi>For yet a little while, and he that ſhall come will come, and will not tarry, Heb.</hi> 10. 35, 37. And now eſpecially bleſſed, <hi>Becauſe it is the time of the end,</hi> and that which was formerly ſealed up is not ſo now, but opened<hi>:</hi> Therefore encouragement is now given to us, to look into this Book; and in ſo doing we may expect his preſence with us, and bleſſing upon us; compare <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 8, 9. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 7, 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the time is at hand.]</hi> Namely, It is ſo in God's account. [See notes on <hi>v.</hi> 1.] That time in which Chriſt came into the world, and finiſhed the work the Father gave him to do in his own perſonal body, is called, <hi>The end of the world,</hi> or worlds, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26. And thoſe days, <hi>the laſt days, Heb.</hi> 1. 1, 2. And the pouring forth of his ſpirit, which was ſaid to be fulfilled in the day of Pentecoſt, was ſaid to be, <hi>in the laſt days, Act.</hi> 2. 17. and that time was <hi>the laſt time,</hi> or hour, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 18. and ſo the time was at hand as compared with former times. And this Phraſe <hi>[At hand]</hi> doth not neceſſarily denote ſuch a ſpeedy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the things ſpoken of, as ſome would perſwade us, as may be ſeen in ſome inſtances; as when the Lord commands <hi>Moſes</hi> to write a Song for the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and therein to declare the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48916:14"/>
Evils and Miſeries that would come upon them in the latter days for their iniquity<hi>:</hi> Certainly, he hath therein ultimately reſpect to the Kingdom of God's being taken from them, and their being deſolat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Romans</hi> in theſe laſt days for their rejection of Chriſt<hi>:</hi> (Though evils in the beginnings, and ſo ſucceſſively came upon them all along, when they forſook God;) and under theſe ſad evils they ſtill remain in theſe latter of the laſt times in which we live, which are about three thouſand years ſince that Song<hi>:</hi> yet thus it is ſaid in that Song; <hi>To me belongeth Vengeance, and to recompence; their Foot ſhall ſlide in due time, for the Day of their Calamity is</hi> [at hand,] <hi>and the things that ſhall come upon them make haſt, Deut.</hi> 31. 19, 29. and ch. 32. 21, 35, 43. Thus again, when the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the Deſtruction that ſhould come upon <hi>Babilon;</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>Howle ye, for the day of the Lord is</hi> [at hand;] <hi>It ſhall come as Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Almighty.</hi> And yet, though that day, or time, was then ſaid to be <hi>[at hand,]</hi> it was near about two hundred years before the Kingdom was tranſlated to the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> which is the firſt thing here propheſied of; as is ſaid, <hi>Behold I will ſtir up the</hi> Medes <hi>againſt them,—and they ſhall have no pity on the fruit of the Womb,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſay</hi>

Crown of Life, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 7. To help <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> againſt thoſe evil and corrupt teachers that were amongſt them, that they might not be carried about with divers and ſtrange teachers; but might turn away from them, and reject them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 3. 6, 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 9. To revive the work in <hi>Sardis,</hi> who had a name that they liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and were dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1, 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1, 3. To incourage and ſtrengthen <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to hold that faſt which they had, that none might take their Crown, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 8. To make fervent and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who were become luke-warm, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22, 23. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16, 18. and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 14, 17, 19. And it is good for every one that hath an Ear to hear what is voted, and deſired for all the Churches.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He votes one thing for them all, that they might rejoyce and have fellowſhip together, and none have ſome ſecret thing with themſelves to rejoyce in, or be comforted withal, <hi>Job.</hi> 15. 11. But that the joy of one might be the joy of them all, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2, 3. In this Grace and Peace the Brother of low degree might rejoyce, in that he is exalted, and the rich that he is made low, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 9, 10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 1, 2. and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He deſires the ſame thing for them all, though ſome of them were greatly faulty, reproved, and threatned; yet while Chriſt hath not caſt them off, but owns them as his Churches, good is to be deſired for them, and love teſtified unto them, and their good is to be endeavoured and purſued, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 3, 4. [See the notes on <hi>v.</hi> 9. and on <hi>v.</hi> 12.] So for the Churches generally this is voted and deſired by the reſidue of the Apoſtles, for ſuch alſo as were much faulty.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This Grace and Peace might be to them, whoſe favour ſoever they wanted; or what troubles, trials, tribulations, or reſtraints ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they met withal; or in what condition or place ſoever they were in: None could let, or hinder them of the knowledge and enjoyment hereof, unleſs they themſelves provoked God to with hold theſe good things from them by their iniquities; no Baniſhments, Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments, thick-walls, or ſtrong-barres could ſhut this out. Conſider this, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9, 11. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 27. and <hi>ch.</hi> 16. 33.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This Grace and Peace is the principal, and moſt excellent thing; and therefore worthy to be deſired, ſought after, embraced and entertained by us<hi>:</hi> He prayeth not for mens favour, or peace in this World for them, or for Riches, Honours, Pleaſures here; but for Grace and Peace to be to them all. This is his vote and deſire for the Churches; and it is inſtructive and imitableforus.</p>

                  <p>From this eternally and infinitely glorious perſon, the Apoſtle votes Grace and Peace to the Churches; For he is the God of Grace, <hi>the God of all Grace,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 10. The God of Peace, the very God of Peace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 20. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 23. He is, and was, and is to come, the God of Grace and Peace.</p>
                  <p>Again, the Apoſtle votes Grace and Peace to be to them from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon, <hi>viz. [And from the ſeven Spirits which are before his Throne.]</hi> To wit, before the Throne of him, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty; who ſits upon the Throne, and whoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ruleth overall. This Grace and Peace is alſo deſired from theſe ſeven Spirits, <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 5. and <hi>ch.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
                  <p>There are different Opinions about theſe ſeven Spirits what they are; they are by ſome ſuppoſed to be ſeven Glorious Angels, becauſe called ſeven, and becauſe of that ſaid in <hi>ch.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>I ſaw the ſeven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels which ſtood before God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But others judge that hereby is meant, the Holy and Eternal Spirit; with whom I herein agree and believe that to be the meaning of the Phraſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe Grace and Peace is voted from the ſeven Spirits, as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48916:17"/>
from the Father and Jeſus Chriſt; but this is never voted from the Angels in any of the Epiſtles of the reſidue of the Apoſtles; but either from the Father and the Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or alſo from the Holy Ghoſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 14. Nor in any other place of the Scripture, that I have ever ſeen produced.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Some do conceive, that <hi>Jacob</hi> votes Grace and Bleſſing from a created Angel in ſaying, <hi>The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bleſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. More generally, Chriſt is ſo called in many places; as, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I ſend an Angel before thee,—beware of him,—for my name is in him, Ex.</hi> 23. 20, 23. ſo alſo he is called, the Angel of his preſence, <hi>Iſay</hi> 63. 9. and the Angel of the Covenant; as is evident, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1. And ſo certainly that ſpeaks of him in <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 16. For,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Angel there ſpoken of is ſaid to have <hi>[redeemed] Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. Now that act and work is never in Scripture applied to any meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly created Angels; but he that redeemed <hi>Jacob,</hi> whether perſonally or nationally conſidered, was, and is <hi>Jehovah, Iſay</hi> 44. 6, 21, 24. and <hi>ch.</hi> 48. 20.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Angel is ſaid to have redeemed him <hi>[from all evil;]</hi> but it is evident, that Angel which redeemed him from the Hand of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eſau,</hi> and from that evil of fear concerning him, was <hi>Jehovah,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> For he wept, and made Supplication, even prayed to that Angel; and who was that Angel? even <hi>Jehovah</hi> the God of Hoſts, <hi>Jehovah</hi> is his name, his Memorial<hi>:</hi> and therefore this was the Angel which redeemed him from all Evil. Compare <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24, 30. with <hi>Hoſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 12. 3. 5.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yea it doth alſo appear, that <hi>Jacob</hi> worſhipped this Angel, which was Chriſt, and worſhipped him by Faith; for ſo it is ſaid<hi>: By Faith,</hi> Jacob <hi>when he was a dying, bleſſed both the Sons of</hi> Joſeph, <hi>and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon the top of his Staff.</hi> Compare <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 16. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 21. By all which it appears. that was no meerly created Angel.</p>
                  <p>2. It further appears, that the ſeven Spirits do mean the Holy and Eternal Spirit; becauſe they are ſignified to be upon Chriſt, that elect precious Stone. Compare <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 6. with <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 8, 9. and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 10. Now the Angels are never ſaid ſo to be upon Chriſt, but the Holy Spirit is often ſaid to be: <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall rest upon him,</hi> Iſay 11. 1, 2. <hi>I have put my truſt upon him,</hi> Iſay 42. 1. And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me,</hi> Iſay 61. 1. Luke 4. 18.</p>
                  <p>3. Becauſe they are named with the Father and the Son, as alſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. And here named before Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:48916:17"/>
4. It alſo appears that hereby the Holy Spirit is intended, becauſe of that Deſcription Chriſt gives of himſelf, in <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 1. when he ſends a meſſage to the Angel of the Church in <hi>Sardis,</hi> of whom he ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt a name that thou liveſt and art dead. Theſe things ſaith he that hath the ſeven Spirits of God:</hi> Surely the underſtanding the ſeven Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to mean that one Spirit, beſt ſuited their condition<hi>:</hi> For hereby he was fitted to ſee and know what they were, to wit, dead; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever name they had: And hereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Nor is that ſaid of the ſeven Angels the ſame with this ſaid of the ſeven Spirits; for they are ſaid to ſtand before God, as miniſtring ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirits, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 2. with <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 10. But theſe ſeven Spirits are only ſaid to be before the Throne, where Chriſt alſo is, and they are upon him, <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 5. and <hi>ch.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
                  <p>Hereby then the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Father and Son, is meant and intended<hi>:</hi> And he may be called <hi>[The ſeven Spirits,]</hi> not with reſpect to his Eſſence: But,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In ſome ſuch ſenſe as Chriſt's Sacrifice is called <hi>[Sacrifices;]</hi> as where it is ſaid, <hi>The Heavenly things muſt be purified with better</hi> [Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices] <hi>than theſe, Heb.</hi> 9. 23. Whereas indeed, that which Chriſt offered for Purgation was but one Oblation once offered; as is ſaid, <hi>After he had offered one Sacrifice for Sins, for ever ſate down,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 10. 10. 12. for, <hi>by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified, v.</hi> 14. 18. and <hi>ch.</hi> 7. 27. and <hi>ch.</hi> 9. 25, 26. Now that one Sacrifice might be called Sacrifices, to ſignifie; that it is the truth, and hath the worth of all other Sacrifices, which are many: yea it is infinitely more acceptable and valuable: So this one Spirit may be called ſeven, to ſignifie, it is the moſt perfect Spirit, (ſeven being a number of perfection;) and infinitely more excellent and glorious than all other, which are miniſtring Spirits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14.</p>

                  <p>Now from this Spirit alſo, Grace and Peace is voted and deſired; for he is <hi>the Spirit of Grace,</hi> Zech. 12. 10. Heb. 10. 29. <hi>the good Spirit, Pſ.</hi> 143. 10. <hi>The Spirit of Love,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 7.

It is not ſaid, that Diſciple that loved Jeſus, though doubtleſs he lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him very much; but, <hi>whom Jeſus loved,</hi> with an high degree of Love, and with a greater degree, it ſeems, than therewith he loved the reſidue of his Diſciples, though he loved them all with the ſame manner of Love; to him are theſe Viſions, and this Revelation given. He now teſtifies Love to thoſe whom he peculiarly loves, not as the World doth unto its Favourites, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 27. Not in preſerving them from afflictions and troubles, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 3. but in manifeſting himſelf, and his ſecret to them, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 25. 14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 21, 23. And many times the more any are beloved of him above others, the more he prefers them before others, in acquainting them with thoſe things which are more hidden and myſterious<hi>:</hi> So he appeared twice to <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was beloved of his God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 25. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 9. with <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 26. So he vouchſafed many Viſions unto <hi>Daniel,</hi> who was a Man greatly beloved, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 23. and <hi>ch.</hi> 10. 11. And ſuch a Viſion of the Son of Man was ſhewed to him, as was to his Apoſtle <hi>John:</hi> In the cloſe of which he is called, <hi>O Man greatly beloved, Dan.</hi> 10. 5, 11. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 12, 17.

He in love laid that Burden upon him before, and now reveals theſe Secrets to him. <hi>And if thou draw out thy Soul to the hungry, and ſatisfie the afflicted Soul,</hi> (eſpecially, ſuch as hear and do the Word of God, who are Chriſt's Mother and Brethren, Luke 8. 20, 21.) <hi>Then ſhall thy light riſe in obſcurity, and thy darkneſs ſhall be as the Noon-day.

                  <p n="1">1. When he thus calls himſelf, even now when he is giving us an account of the Viſions he received of the Lord, in which he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before them; yet now he ſaith, <hi>your Brother and Companion:</hi> one that had the ſame Father and Mother; the ſame Foundation of Faith, matter of feeding, hope of the Inheritance, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3, 7, 11. There is an aptneſs in ſuch as are ſo favoured, to be lifted up thorow the abundance of Revelations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 1, 7. but it was not ſo with him. When he writes to the Believers of the Word of God and Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Requirings, Inſtructions and Conſolations thereof, then he calls them, <hi>little Children,</hi> and, <hi>my little Children,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1. and <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 18. and now when he is acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with thoſe high things that were revealed to him, he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately calls them <hi>Brethren.</hi> It was much in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to that height, that he was next <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to ſay, <hi>I am</hi> Joſeph <hi>your Brother, Gen.</hi> 45. 4. But this was more remarkable in <hi>John,</hi> when he was ſo lifted up of the Lord; and like unto our Lord Jeſus, when he was riſen from the dead, <hi>Go to my Brethren, and ſay unto them, I aſcend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Father, and your Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20 17. Thus <hi>John</hi> ſaith, not your Father and Head like the Man of Sin, but <hi>your Brother.</hi> Oh! if any of us be lifted up in the things of this World, or in thoſe more excellent, appertaining to the Kingdom of Heaven, let us not be exalted above meaſure thereby, but own our ſelves as Brethren of ſuch Believers, before whom we are preferred in theſe things; like him, who though he were a King and a Prophet, yet was a Companion of all them that feared the Lord, and of them that kept his Precepts: How poor and mean ſoever they were, yet they were his Brethren and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 122. 5. 8. with <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 63.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The great Mercy of God to us Gentiles. <hi>John</hi> was one of the Natural Branches; but by the Blood of Chriſt, we Gentiles are made nigh, and contrary to nature are graffed in amongſt the Natural Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;

and with them partake of the root and fatneſs of the Olive-tree, and ſo are made Fellow-Citizens with the Saints and of the Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17, 22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 11, 20. A great Myſtery, and wonderful Grace and Favour! That the Gentiles ſhould be Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Heirs, and of the ſame Body, and partakers of his Promiſe in Chriſt by the Goſpel<hi>:</hi> They are all the Children of God by Faith<hi>: in Chriſt Jeſus, there is neither Jew nor Greek,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26, 29. and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 26, 31. Oh that we may not be high-minded, but fear! <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. and that we may walk worthy of God, who hath called us unto his Kingdom and glory, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 1. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 12. and may <hi>ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free; and not be again entangled with the yoke of bondage, Gal</hi> 4. 26, 31. and <hi>ch.</hi> 5. 1.</p>

Them he calls Brethren intimately of whom, or of many, or moſt of whom, he was not the firſt Inſtrument of begetting them thorow the Goſpel, and to them he is Commanded to write, and writeth what followeth.

But on this account he mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered not who was the Inſtrument, whether himſelf or others, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 11. yet ſtill, <hi>I am your Brother and Companion.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> would that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> knew what great Conflict he had for them, and for them at <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and as many as had not ſeen his face in the fleſh; that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 1, 4. Men may love them whom they ſuppoſe, they have been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of begetting thorow the Goſpel, becauſe herein they have been honoured; while they have too little love for others, to whom others have been firſt Inſtruments of Good.

And ſo we may learn,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> and all the Churches, were in tribulation: for he was their Brother and Companion therein; and alſo ſympathiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them in theirs<hi>:</hi> They were all in tribulation, though not all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in it.

And the Apoſtle told the Diſciples, <hi>they muſt thorow much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God, Act.</hi> 14. 22. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35, 36. manifold afflictions and Perſecutions did attend the Apoſtles: yea, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>All that will live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer perſecution, Mat.</hi> 10. 23, 25. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 11, 13. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 34. 19. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 9. Though Chriſt loveth his diſciples, yet he doth not now this way teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy love to them in preſerving them from tribulation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 27. But in love to them he now tries them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 3, 7. this is not to be looked for in this World by them that follow Chriſt, <hi>Luke.</hi> 12. 49, 51. reſt is not aſſured to them, till the Lord Jeſus be revealed from Heaven, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 5, 7. when there are new Heavens and a new Earth, then God will wipe away all tears from their eyes, and not before compleatly, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 1, 4. how are they miſtaken who talk of <hi>Halcionian</hi> dayes here, and reigning now on earth? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8, 12.

Thus God dealt with all, and with the Prophet alſo, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 10, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 12, 13.—and he was their Companion, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in bearing, and ſympathizing with them; As the expreſſion is uſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 33 34. <hi>He had Compaſſion on them weeping with them, &amp;c.

This is the Believers proper tribulation, the bonds of the Goſpel, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 66. 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 10, 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The tribulation of Chriſt, to wit, that which Jeſus Chriſt owned as his, and therefore ſympathized with them therein, and took notice of their afflictions: <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflicted, Iſay</hi> 63. 9. hence he ſaith, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? Act.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17, 18. and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 15, 16. he reckoneth that which was done unto his Brethren as done unto him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 45. Now here we may obſerve by way of Inference from what hath been ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that he was their Companion in the tribulation of Jeſus Chriſt, and that they did indure tribulation for Chriſt's ſake amongſt many of whom were many miſcarriages and faults, for which afterward they are reproved; So we may ſee, that ſuch believers as have faults may yet ſuffer for Chriſt and the Goſpels ſake: ſo here, ſee <hi>ch.</hi> 2. 13, 15, 19, 20, he may count ſuch worthy of this grace and favour, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. 30.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that the Apoſtle was their Companion in tribulation, and in compaſſion and fellow-feeling; ſo it ſignifieth. that the grace of God moves us to pity others of our Brethren when they are in affliction, though we may be our ſelves in tribulation alſo, and not ſo to pore and look upon our own things as to be forgetful of them. Thus the Apoſtle, when he tells the <hi>Philippians: 'tis given to you in the behalf of Chriſt, not onely to believe but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake; yet he preſently exhorts them, look not every man on his own things, but every one alſo on the things of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Let this mind be in you which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus, &amp;c. Phil.</hi> 1. 29, 30. with <hi>ch.</hi> 2. 1, 4, 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 2, 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 25, 26. nay, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times God is ordering affliction to us, that we might learn thereby, and be fitted to pity others, <hi>Jona.</hi> 4. 7, 11.

And thus it would alſo be with us, were the Grace of God yielded up to by us; we ſhould not only mind our own troubles, but conſider the trials and afflictions of others alſo. Thus it was with this Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When he was their Companion in the tribulation of Jeſus Chriſt, then this Book was ſent and ſignified to him<hi>:</hi> ſo elſe-where many times when his people have been in affliction, God hath wonderfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared

                  <p>1. What is this Kingdom? It is ſaid to be that of Jeſus Chriſt, as oppoſed to the Kingdom of Sin, Satan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea and as preferred above and oppoſed to the Kingdom of men: <hi>my Kingdom is not of this world,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 36.

The beginning of this Kingdom, and means by which it is brought unto us, and rules over us, is the Marriage of our Nature to the Divine Nature in the perſon of the Word, the Son of God, and his abaſement therein: as it is ſaid, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King which made a Marriage for his Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 1, 4.

                  <p n="1">1. That Believers may be in tribulation, and in the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt together: their being now in his Kingdom doth not exempt them from tribulation, though ſuch ſhall be kept from evil; nor doth their ſuffering Tribulation, the Tribulation of Chriſt, exclude them his Kingdom.

                  <p n="1">1. It is a patient continuance in well doing, enduring therein even to the end, and not being weary, or fainting in our minds, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 9. receiving the Word of the Kingdom, and bringing forth fruits with Patience, with Perſeverance, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 15.

And ſo alſo it is, a patient continuance in holding forth the profeſſion of the Faith without wavering, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 23, 25.

And eſpecially ſeeking the good of them that are

of the Houſhold of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1, 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 9, 10. And continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in prayer, watching thereunto, and therein with all perſeverance<hi>:</hi> praying always and not fainting, or being out-evill'd, <hi>Luk</hi> 18. 1. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 2.

                  <p n="2">2. This patience is alſo to be exerciſed in a meek and quiet induring tribulations and afflictions: thus when our Saviour acquaints his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples what hard uſage they ſhoud meet with in the World, he thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them; <hi>In your patience poſſeſs ye your ſouls, Luke</hi> 21. 16. 18. and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts<hi>: Be patient in tribulation, Rom.</hi> 12. 12. and gloried in the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> in the Churches of God, for their patience—in all their perſecutions and tribulations which they endured, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 10. which patience is not an inſenſibleneſs of the affliction, or being like a ſtock or a ſtone: for this is blockiſhneſs, or ſtupidity, rather then patience, and no vertue but a vice: like that reproved, <hi>they cry out when he bindeth them, Joh.</hi> 36. 13. <hi>thou haſt ſtricken them, but they have not grieved, Jer.</hi> 5. 3. who was ſo patient as our Lord Jeſus? <hi>Pſ.</hi> 40. 1. and yet he was ſenſible of his afflictions, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 22. 1, 2. <hi>he offered up prayers, and ſupplications with ſtrong crying and tears, Heb.</hi> 5. 7. but this patience is oppoſed to pride, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 8. and to fretting and ſtriving, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 27. 7, 8. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 23, 24, and ſo it is to be exerciſed towards God, in an humble and meek bearing his Hand, and not haſtening deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from under it out of his way, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5, 6. and towards men, in not fretting againſt them in our hearts, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 37. 1, 7. nor reviling them or rendring railing for railing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20, 22. and much leſs reſiſting their evil with force and violence, for all that thus take the Sword ſhall periſh by the ſword, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 9, 10. and <hi>ch.</hi> 14. 12. thus Patience is to be exerciſed in induring tribulation, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 36.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And this patience of Jeſus doth alſo conſiſt in a waiting for the Lord, for his teaching, direction, conſolation, and ſalvation<hi>:</hi> as the Pſalmiſt inſtructs, <hi>reſt in the LORD, and wait patiently for him, Pſ.</hi> 37. 7. and which the Prophet commends to us in ſaying: <hi>It is good that a Man ſhould both hope, and quietly wait for the Salvation of the LORD, Lam.</hi> 3. 26. and ſo to wait for the Lord from Heaven, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 10. Even as the Husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 7, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 25. not taking up ſhort in any thing here, but expecting and looking for him till he cometh: that when he appeareth we may ſay, <hi>Loe this is our God, we</hi>

                     <hi>have waited for him, and he will ſave us. This is the LORD, we have waited for him we will be glad and rejoyce in his Salvation, Iſay.</hi> 25. 9. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20, 21. and <hi>Bleſſed are all they that wait for him, Iſay</hi> 30. 18.</p>
                  <p>2. Why is this called the <hi>patience of Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is ſuch-like patience as he exerciſed while he was here: he continued in well-doing, <hi>he went up and down doing good, Acts</hi> 10. 38.

Though he knew no ſin, yet when he was reviled he reviled not again, when he ſuffered he threatned not, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21, 23. Though he could have deſtroyed them all, yet he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the contradiction of ſinners againſt himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 3. and <hi>he waited patiently for the Lord, till he inclined his ear, and heard him: and brought him out of the horrible pit, and out of the miry clay,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3.</p>

1. He was in tribulation and patience; Men may be ſo: he was ſo, and they were ſo: and having acceſs by faith into the grace of God in Chriſt, tribulation worketh patience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 5. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 2, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

2. That often times, thoſe who are adverſaries to the Goſpel have the greateſt ſpight at ſuch as are teachers of others, and go before them in the Word of the Lord: and eſpecially at the moſt eminent of them<hi>:</hi> ſo it ſeems, the Apoſtles generally were in affliction, and under perſecution, when other believers endured no ſuch thing; yea when ſome of them talked of reigning, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; <hi>I think that God hath ſet forth us the Apoſtles laſt, as it were Men appointed to Death; for we are made a ſpectacte to the World, and to Angels and Men:</hi> ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 13. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 5, 7, 19. and <hi>ch.</hi> 17. 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> was in this Iſle, and thus baniſhed, he had theſe viſions and Revelations of the Lord vouchſafed to him: ſo it was with <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> when he was in Captivity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 1, 3. and <hi>ch.</hi> 40. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and with <hi>Daniel, ch.</hi> 1. 3, 6. and <hi>ch.</hi> 2. 14, 25. and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>ch.</hi> 5. 10, 13. and <hi>ch.</hi> 7. and <hi>ch.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where-ever we are, he can reveal to us ſecret and hidden things: none, no perſon or place, can ſhut out his Light and inſtruction from us, or hinder us from his gracious preſence; and many times, when his people are under eminent ſufferings for his names ſake, he then draws neer unto them, and manifeſteth himſelf and his things to them<hi>:</hi> his Bleſſings are on the heads of them that ſeparate, and ſeparated from their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 26. and though their enemies think evil againſt them, in perſecuting and baniſhing them, yet God orders it for great good, to them and others, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 20.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 We may alſo ſee, that all power is Chriſts both in Heaven and on earth; ſo as none can go any further than he permits in afflicting his people. Doubtleſs, they that Baniſhed <hi>John</hi> had malice enough to have killed him: but he to whom all judgment and government is committed hindred them; and as it were ſaid; <hi>Hitherto ſhall thou go and no further:</hi> ſurely the wrath of man ſhall praiſe him, and the remainder he will reſtrain, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 76. 10.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We have to conſider the cauſe and reaſon of his being in the Iſle of <hi>Patmos:</hi> and that was <hi>[For the Word of God, and for the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt:]</hi> for the explication whereof [ſee notes on <hi>v.</hi> 2.] But here note,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He was not baniſhed thither for being a Jew ſimply, or ſuch an account as thoſe ſpoken of <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 2, 3. Chriſtians may be baniſhed and yet not as Chriſtians, but ſuffer in a common calamity<hi>:</hi> but it was not ſo here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor was he baniſhed for evil doing; for reſiſting or rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Authorities that were over him. There is no cauſe to rejoyce
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48916:37"/>
in ſuch ſufferings, but to be aſhamed of them; nor for evil-doing in a more general acceptation. <hi>Let noneof you ſuffer as a Murtherer, or as a Thief, or as an Evil doer, or as a Buſy-body in other Mens matters,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 16, 17. and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 15, 16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But his ſufferings were <hi>for the Word of God, and for the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to wit, <hi>for the Goſpel;</hi> becauſe he had faithfully preached and declared that. That which rendred him a meet Subject in Chriſt's Account, to have this Revelation ſent and ſignified to him, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. rendred him an Object of the Anger and Diſpleaſure of the Emperor, and was the cauſe of his baniſhment. <hi>The LORD ſeeth not as Man ſeeth;</hi> and herein his Sufferings and Tribulations were upon the ſame account as his Brethrens were; not for trivial things, and much leſs for doing evil, or not doing what was good, and he might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do; but for the Kingdom of Heaven's ſake, and ſo for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel's ſake, like herein to <hi>Paul;</hi> he endured bonds for Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 12, 13. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 11, 12.

Joh.</hi> 6. 63. begetting them to a lively hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13. and comforting them, and filling them with Joy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 14, 15. and <hi>ch.</hi> 15. 26. and they in whom he dwelleth richly, are in the Spirit as the way, walking in him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 16, 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13, 14. But here the Phraſe ſignifieth ſome further thing, to wit, a being in the Spirit after an extraordinary manner; ſo as that a Man is carried out of, and above himſelf, divinely tranſported, and carried up of, and filled with the Spirit: ſo the voice ſaid, <hi>Come up hither,</hi> aſcend up thither; <hi>and immediately I was in the Spirit.</hi> [See Notes on <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2.] It is the ſame thing as is ſpoken by <hi>Paul,</hi> of a Man in Chriſt, whether in the Body or no he could not tell; caught up in the Spirit into the ſight of, and fitted for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding high and myſterious things; (as the Spirits being in a Man, and Chriſts being in him, are uſed indifferently, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9, 10:) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 1, 5, 7.

                  <p>On this Day he heard this Voice, which might be an encouragement and provocation to us to keep it holy, and therein to remember the Lord's Death; and what he hath thereby done for us, and obtained, and is become; and the love of both Father and Son therein commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us.</p>

This writting in a Book is a bleſſed means for conveying the word of God to poſterity, and for the perpetuating it in the Records thereof: Hence the Lord ſaith unto the prophet: <hi>Now go write it before them in a Table, and note it in a Book that it may be for the time to come</hi> (for the latter day) <hi>for ever and ever, Iſay.</hi> 30. 8.

So here, when <hi>John</hi> was in baniſhment under an Heathen Governour, yet he had liberty to write.

                  <p>To this we need not, nor ſhall enlarge; our Lord doth plainly open to us what is ſignified to us thereby, when he openeth this myſtery, and ſaith, <hi>[The ſeven Candleſticks which thou ſaweſt are the ſeven Churches, Rev.</hi> 1. 20.] To wit, the ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> whom the Apoſtle doth ſalute, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and which are particularly named, <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Why are theſe Churches called and compared to Candleſticks?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are to bear forth the light unto, and before others; to wit, the word of life, or Chriſt in the Goſpel<hi>:</hi> the light of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goſpel of Chriſt: and thus they were to ſhine forth, and to be as lights in the World, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13, 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 35. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. as in our Types, the Candleſtick was for the light, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 14. <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. 9. So Chriſt's Churches are Candleſticks to bear the light, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 23. And this they are to do,</p>
                  <p>In Word and Confeſſion, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9, 10.

                     <hi>Children of light, Eph.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>The way of the just is as the ſhining light, which ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day, Prov.</hi> 4. 18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11, 12. and <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 1. 16. This is the proper uſe of Candleſticks.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are called Candleſticks, to denote that they are not light in themſelves, nor can enlighten others, or be inſtruments of good one to another, unleſs the Word of Chriſt be received and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them; they muſt continually hold forth that, or elſe they can be of no uſefulneſs as Candleſticks: what uſe is the Candleſtick of unleſs a light be in it? A Candleſtick without that cannot light others. Truly, they can do nothing without Chriſt; though they are light, yet it is not in themſelves, but in the Lord, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 4, 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                  <p>If any ſay, but the Angels are called and compared to Stars, and they are light bodies, and have the light abiding in them, and ſo the Angels are always herein uſeful, to give light, but not the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which are Candleſticks. To that I ſay,</p>
                  <p>Theſe Metaphorical Expreſſions are not to be extended too far: The moſt eminent Inſtruments and Miniſters of Chriſt have nothing, but what they have received, and do receive from Chriſt, the Sun of Righteouſneſs. The moſt eminent Inſtruments may ſay and confeſs as that famous Apoſtle of the Gentiles doth, that they are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of themſelves to think any thing as of themſelves, but their ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency is of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2, 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3, 5. And though the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are here called Stars, yet the Prophets are called elſewhere Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 4. And though here the Churches are called Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks, yet elſewhere the Saints in general are ſaid to be, <hi>the Light of the World, Mat.</hi> 5. 14. and to be light in the Lord, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. and are exhorted to ſhine as lights in the World, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 15. but neither the one, nor the other have light in themſelves as of themſelves; but of the fulneſs of Chriſt they all receive, and Grace for Grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14, 16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4. They are compared to Candleſticks, to teach us, that it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they may be removed, and put out of the place they are in for their evils; even as it fared of old with our Types, <hi>Jer.</hi> 52. 16, 19.

Hereafter they ſhall be fixt as the Sun, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 41, 44. they ſhall be as Pillars in the Houſe of God, and ſhall go no more out, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 12.

                  <p>1. With alluſion and reſpect to our Types in former times, to whom there is frequent reference in this Book. Their Candleſticks were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Gold, as may be ſeen, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 31. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 7. and <hi>ch.</hi> 13. 11.</p>
                  <p>3. They are ſaid to be golden, as called after Chriſt, who is that Gold tried in the Fire, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Job.</hi> 22. 25.

                  <p>3.

                  <p>To this I only ſay here; the Girdle doth ſignifie, his Righteouſneſs and Faithfulneſs: and ſo it might denote to us, that though he had not yet made the Atonement by his Blood, yet he was righteous and faithful, God's righteous Servant, who would do it in due time. But though he had the Girdle, yet he might not be, or appear glorious in his Apparel, becauſe the work was not finiſhed, though he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways faithful. But now he hath finiſhed the work the Father gave him to do in his own Perſonal Body, he is glorified, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4, 5. <hi>Iſay</hi> 11. 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. And ſo,</p>

                     <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons had Garments, holy Garments, to Miniſter in for beauty and Glory; that were beautiful, fair, and pleaſant; and glorious, ſplendid, rich, and full of luſtre, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 1, 3. So our high prieſt, Jeſus the Son of Man, he is clothed with the Garments of beauty, the beauty of holineſs, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 110. 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. and Glory; <hi>the God of our fathers hath glorified his Son Jeſus, Acts</hi> 3. 13. <hi>I will,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

Iſay</hi> 61. 1, 2, 10, 11. he is now become beautiful and glorious in his apparel, as the Prophet ſignifieth when he Prophetically ſaith: <hi>In that day ſeven Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhall take hold of one Man</hi> (even of this one Man) <hi>ſaying, we will wear our own apparel, only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach.</hi> (We would be called Chriſtians notwithſtanding, and not Heathens Pagans, Infidels.) <hi>In that day ſhall the Branch of the Lord be beauty and Glory.</hi> Compare <hi>Iſay.</hi> 4. 1, 2. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 2.</p>
                  <p>Now then; as the High-prieſt in former times did bear the names of the Children of Iſrael in two ſtones upon the ſhouldiers of his Ephod (which Ephod was a part of his Raiment,) for a <hi>Memorial</hi> to (or as ſome tranſlations read it for a <hi>remembrance</hi> of) the Children of Iſrael, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 6, 12. and <hi>ch.</hi> 39. 6, 7. ſo our High-prieſt who hath born our ſins on his body on the tree, now bears the names of them that ſo hear and learn of the Father as to come unto him, upon his ſhouldiers before the Lord, that they might always be had in remembrance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him<hi>:</hi> he preſents them in his raiment, and Righteouſneſs; and ſo the memory and name of the juſt is Bleſſed, but the name of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall Rot, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 7. <hi>The righteous ſhall be in everlaſting Remembrance, Pſ.</hi> 112. 6. and he beareth their names upon his ſhoulders for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial to his Iſrael, that they may Remember and rejoyce in this, that their High-prieſt carrieth their names upon his ſhoulders, and preſents them in the body of his fleſh thorow death holy, unreprovable, and unrebukeable in his ſight, they continuing in the Faith grounded and ſettled, <hi>&amp;c.

he is one who is Beautiful and glorious in his apparel in the eyes of the Lord<hi>:</hi> And his Garments are of his own making as Mediatour, as the Garments of <hi>Aaron</hi> were made by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Mediatour of that Teſtament, <hi>Exod</hi> 28. 1, 2, 3, 39, 40. and on the ſhoulders thereof he beareth them up, and carrieth them, and preſents them before the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 11, 12. <hi>Iſay.</hi> 46 3, 4. yea their names are graven in ſtones, in precious ſtones, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 9, 11. to ſignify, they ſhall be had in remembrance for ever before the Lord: for ſo much the graving, or engraving of them may ſignifie, A perpetual preſentation, and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of them<hi>:</hi> as when <hi>Job</hi> is declaring the root of the matter, he not only deſireth that what he ſpake were written; nor onely that they were printed in a book, but alſo that they were graven with an iron-Pen and laid in the rock forever, <hi>Job</hi> 19. 23, 24.

                  </p>
                  <p>Again; in former times the typical High-prieſt did in the breaſt-plate of judgment bear the names of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon his heart for a memorial before the Lord continually, whoſe names were engraven in twelve ſtones and all upon his heart, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 13. 29. and <hi>ch.</hi> 39. 8. 14. To ſignifie his tender and cordial love and compaſſion to them. So our merciful and gracious High-prieſt beareth the names of his <hi>Iſrael</hi> on his heart<hi>:</hi> not upon ſome outward Garment only, which might be put off, and then the names are laid aſide alſo, which are only ſo engraven; but even upon his heart: As the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>I have you in my heart: for God is my record how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> In and with ſuch bowels as were begot by, and like unto Chriſts bowels towards them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 7, 8. as if he would thereby ſignifie to us, that Chriſt's bowels and bowelly affection was ſo towards them, that he indeed had them in his heart: he carries them in his boſom, <hi>Iſay</hi> 30. 11. he loveth them with peculiar manner of love, who from his firſt love known and believed, do love him.

But he loveth them that love him, becauſe he firſt loved them, with another manner of love, with a delightful well-pleaſed love: all his delight is in the Saints that are in the earth, and in the excellent ones, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 17, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 16. 2, 3. as the Father hath loved him, ſo he loveth them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 9, 13. and <hi>ch.</hi> 14. 21, 23. he loveth them, and beareth them on his heart and breaſt, when (and that is always) he appeareth before God; and on his breaſt-plate which is righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Iſay</hi> 59. 17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 14, he forgiveth them and clotheth and adorneth them; and hath bowelly affection and hearty love to them.

                  <p>And they being thus in and on the heart of Chriſt, they are and ſhall be in his mouth alſo: for <hi>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Mat.</hi> 12. 34. they are in his mouth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16. their ſorrows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhall be multiplied that haſten after another, or give gifts unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother High-prieſt and mediatour.

                  <p>And they being engraven on his heart, his arme is engaged for them to bear them and to deliver them from evil, and from the fear of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in their hearkening unto him<hi>:</hi> and they are in, and engraven in his hand; ſo as he will not forget them, but whatever he openeth his hand to do, ſo he will, behold them, and have ſuch reſpect to them, that <hi>ſhall work together for good to them that love him, and none ſhall pluck them</hi>

                  <p>And in the breſt-plate of judgment, and on the heart of the High-prieſt in our types of old, he did bear the judgment of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> before the Lord continually<hi>:</hi> either to figure out, that our Jeſus, our great High-prieſt, doth ſympathize with his people in all their judgments, and occaſions of ſorrow and ſadneſs: <hi>In all their afflictions he was affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Or rather<hi>:</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> the Mediatour of the firſt Teſtament was by the appointment of God, to put in the Breſt-plate of judgment which was upon <hi>Aaron's</hi> heart the <hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim,</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> gave a moſt perfect light in any difficult matter to him that enquired thereat; and without which they would not determine in thoſe things which were doubtful and difficult, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. 63. <hi>Neh.</hi> 7. 65. Hereby it ſeems, God revealed his mind, and counſel in former times; and when they enquired thereat, the Perſon enquiring was to ſtand before the High-prieſt with his face towards the Breſt-plate of judgment, and (as is obſerved by ſome) a moſt perfect light ſhone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the letters, that were all upon the Breaſt-plate, in order one after another, whereby the mind of God was made known and revealed, and the enquirer had thereby judgment and diſcerning given to him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27. 21. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 30. <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. 8. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 6. and hereby in general was ſignified that the High prieſt then by the <hi>

                  <p>So now, our High-prieſt is he that hath the <hi>

What unbelief, diſtractions, wandrings of the thoughts and deſires, Pride, deſires of Vain-glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are found with them in their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Exerciſes; they may in ſome meaſure know, and be ſenſible of, and groan under the burden of, that examine themſelves, and ſearch and try their hearts and ways in the light of the Lord. So that if their holy things were not cleanſed by him, and he did not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally take away the iniquities of their Spiritual Sacrifices, and good deeds, God might juſtly blot them out, and throw the dung of them into their Faces, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 14, 22. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 3. All their Righteouſneſſes, as they come from them, are as filthy rags, <hi>Iſay</hi> 64. 4, 6.

When they are going unto, and making uſe of their Advocate for any Man that ſinneth, yet unleſs Jeſus Chriſt the righteous were alſo the propitiation for their Sins, even in their thus approaching to him, their Prayers and Requeſts would not be heard and granted, but turned away and rejected, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1, 2. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 66. 20, and 5. 7.</p>
                  <p>But now, Jeſus Chriſt is a merciful and faithful High-prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the Sins of the People, even for the Sins of his People alſo, who have him as their Advocate<hi>:</hi> He is their Peace, who hath made peace for them, ever living to make interceſſion for them; and they are inſtructed in that reſpect to conſider him, as the <hi>High-prieſt of their Profeſſion, Heb.</hi> 2. 17, 18. and <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 1. And therefore do they triumph, and this is that which lifteth up their Heads and Hearts, that he who died, yea rather is riſen again, is now on the right hand of God, making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for them. Hence that challenge; <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God</hi>'s <hi>Elect? It is God that juſtifieth, who ſhall condemn, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34. Otherwiſe Satan would condemn them, and his Condemnation would be of force againſt them, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1, 5. And indeed, the Senſe and Conſcience of their manifold Mixtures, Defilements and Pollutions in all their holy things, would even diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them, and hinder them from approaching into the preſence of him who is an Holy Lord God, and make them afraid of him, had they not one one to appear as their Holineſs, who covereth and taketh

away all their Iniquities, and rendreth them and their holy things acceptable. Hence ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>Seeing we have a great High-prieſt that is paſſed into the Heavens, Jeſus the Son of God, let us hold faſt our profeſſion;</hi> (otherwiſe we might even let it go:) <hi>Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy, and find Grace for ſeaſonable help, Heb.</hi> 4. 14, 16. and <hi>ch.</hi> 10. 19, 22, 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8, 19.

be his diſciples, and are not ſo indeed, but only cleave to him and his people with flatteries<hi>:</hi> yea it doth diſcover and make manifeſt all, and that to a gracious end, while it is called to day; that Men might awake and ſtand up from the dead; and ſo conſider themſelves and their ways, as to turn their feet unto his Teſtimonies, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 22, 23, 24.</p>

Thus he deſcribes himſelf to the Angel of the Church in <hi>Pergamus: Theſe things ſaith he who hath the ſharp Sword with two edges: I know thy works,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But I have a few things againſt thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt here them that hold the Doctrine of Balaam,—So haſt thou alſo them that hold the Doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate, repent or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight againſt them with the Sword of my Mouth, Rev.</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14, 16. Or more generally, when his people are guilty of great abominations, and perſiſt therein, and repent not thereof, he will uſe this ſharp Sword againſt them; with this Word, which is as a Sword, the prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> came to deſtroy the City, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. 3, and the Lord ſaith to <hi>Jeremy: Behold I have put my words in thy mouth: See, I have this day ſet thee over the nations, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to deſtroy, and to throw down, &amp;c. Jer.</hi> 1. 8, 10. and in due ſeaſon he will ſlay all the wicked, whether in or out of the Church<hi>:</hi> As it is ſaid: <hi>He ſhall ſmite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips ſhall he ſlay the wicked, Iſay.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 15, 21. And herewith alſo he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend from danger, build, and plant all thoſe that follow him, and cleave unto him with full purpoſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 10. and ſeeing his word is as a ſharp two-edged Sword, it may inſtruct us to take it, and make uſe of it, that we may overcome all our enemies: As it is ſaid of ſome, <hi>They overcame Satan with the blood of the Lamb, and with the word of their Teſtimony, &amp;c. Rev.</hi> 12. 11. So the Apoſtle when he tells the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that they wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, againſt powers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he then exhorts them to take unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the whole armour of God: and particularly, <hi>The Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, Eph.</hi> 6. 10, 12, 17. This word of God

In which ſayings both the good and holy Men conclude, that if they were taken out of the Land of the living, they ſhould go into this Hell; ſo the Preacher propounds this unto all, to provoke them to preſent diligence<hi>: whatſoever thine hand finds to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Grave, or in Hell, whither thou goeſt, Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 10.

                     <hi>and hath given him Authority to execute judgment alſo, becauſe he is the Son of Man, Joh.</hi> 5. 22, 27. And ſo he hath power to order and ſend any affliction to us. When we are judged with any Judgments, we are chaſtened of this Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 30, 32. Our times are in his hand; and when he pleaſeth he can remove us hence; for <hi>he hath the Keys of Hell and Death.</hi> The Son of Man who hath a Golden Crown on his Head, hath in his hand a ſharp Sickle, the Sickle of death, to cut Men down therewith at his pleaſure, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13, 14, 16. And ſo now, he did permit, or order this deadneſs unto the Apoſtle. He can, when he pleaſes, open the Door of Death, and let Men, yea put Men in thereat; and none can ſtay his hand: <hi>No man hath power over the Spirit to retain the Spirit; neither hath he power in the Day of death, and there is no diſcharge in that War, Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 8. And he hath power alſo, and will in due ſeaſon, with his Keys, open the Graves of all, and cauſe them to come out of them; and will open theirs who ſleep in him, and bring them forth unto the Reſurrection of Life, and ſo to their endleſs and eternal Joy and comfort, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 12, 13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 28, 29.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

And he hath power to ſhut upon a Man, when he takes away his life, and there can be no open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He can with his Keys lock them up in the Houſe of Death, and detain them as Priſoners; and then there is no coming out until he open the Door. If he cut off, and ſhut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him? <hi>Job.</hi> 11. 10. <hi>Behold he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again; he ſhuts upon a Man, and there can be no opening, Job</hi> 12. 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How hath he obtained the Keys of Hell and Death?</p>

By bearing the Judgment of the World, he hath caſt Satan, the Prince of the World out of his principality, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 31. and all power is given unto him both in Heaven and on Earth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18, 20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9, 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 27. and <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 35. with <hi>ch.</hi> 10. 17.

                  <p>And ſeeing he hath, and hath thus obtained the Keys of Hell and Death, it may be of much uſefulneſs unto us; as to ſay a little.</p>

A myſtery doth ſignify to us in general, A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thing, and that which is not obvious to every capacity; and in ſcripture it ſignifieth ſome excellent ſecret alſo: and it may ſtill retain the name after it is opened, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2. and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 3. ſo we read of <hi>the myſtery of Chriſt,</hi> which was ſecret comparatively, till he came into the World<hi>:</hi> and not ſo clearly opened, till the Spirit was poured forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apoſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25, 26. and this myſtery was made known by Chriſt, and God in him, unto them. By Revelation he made known the myſtery unto them. that by them it might be made known to us<hi>:</hi> and they have ſo plainly declared it, that when we read we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their knowledge in the myſtery of Chriſt: which in other ages was not made known unto the Sons of Men, as it is now revealed unto his holy Apoſtles and Prophets by the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 9, and <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>2. And indeed many times, a myſtery doth ſignify ſome ſecret thing ſet forth to us by ſome ſignes, Symbols, Shadows, Parables <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo Chriſt was formerly typed forth under many types and Shadows<hi>:</hi> as the myſtery of <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder, of the ſacrifices, Rock, Brazen-ſerpent, Tabernacle, Temple, Ark, Propitiatory, High-prieſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was Jeſus Chriſt; as is manifeſted unto us, now the myſtery is opened, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17, with <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 52. and <hi>ch.</hi> 2. 21. and <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 14.

                  <p>Now here we may obſerve for our uſefulneſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that our Lord here opens the myſtery by his ſpirit, ſo we may learn that Chriſt is the revealer of ſecrets, and of hidden things unto us: <hi>upon him reſteth the ſpirit of the Lord, the ſpirit of wiſdom, underſtanding, &amp;c.</hi> and by this ſpirit he reveals myſterious things: for the ſpirit ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, even the depths of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10, 12. with <hi>Iſay.</hi> 11. 1, 3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 1, 3. <hi>Luke.</hi> 24. 44, 46. and indeed he is in the boſom of the Father, and knows all his mind and counſels, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 18. and <hi>ch.</hi> 10. 15. This whole revelation God gave unto Chriſt to ſhew, <hi>&amp;c. v.</hi> 1. and <hi>ch.</hi> 5. 1, 9. This therefore might engage us, when we are in the dark

                  <p n="2">2. In that he opens the myſtery to <hi>John,</hi> ſo it teacheth us, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the beſt of Men, and thoſe that have moſt underſtanding of, and acquaintance with the word of God, and Teſtimony of Jeſus, and have been declarers of the ſame, [ſee notes on <hi>v.</hi> 2.] yet they have nothing but what is given them from above, <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And this might hide pride from ſuch, and keep them from glorying in God's preſence, as if they had not received, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 29, 31. and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 7. See, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 30.</p>
                  <p>And it might preſerve us from having Idolatrous eſteems of Men, or glorying in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 1, 5. and <hi>ch.</hi> 3, 19, 21. and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 1, 6, 7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Seeing this myſtery is opened to his ſervant <hi>John,</hi> ſo it may inſtruct us, that <hi>the ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him:</hi> and <hi>to him that hath ſhall be given.</hi> Indeed he herein prefers ſome of them before other ſome; but yet ſtill, <hi>He giveth wiſdom to the wiſe, and knowledge to them that know underſtanding, Pſ.</hi> 25. 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 9, 11. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 21, 22.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. He ſaith not; The ſeven ſtars are the ſeven Angels, though he calls them in the ſymbol ſeven ſtarrs<hi>:</hi> yet he names them not in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the myſtery ſeven Angels, but, the Angels: and yet when he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the myſtery of the ſeven candleſticks, he ſtill calls them ſeven Churches: ſurely to intimate, that the Angels were not ſeven individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al perſons, but indefinitely, thoſe that were Guides unto the ſeven Churches, and went before them in the Word of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>If any ſay; it may be enough to conclude them to be but ſeven Individual Perſons, becauſe they are called the ſeven Stars, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 16, 20. and <hi>ch.</hi> 2. 1. and <hi>ch.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 1. I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That might rather have ſufficed as with reſpect to the ſeven Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks, to call them Churches; becauſe he had called them ſeven Churches before, verſe 4. and named them particularly, verſe 11. and yet here again he calls them ſeven Churches; whereas he never calls the ſeven Stars ſeven Angels. And beſides,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though the ſeveral Epiſtles be directed to the ſeveral Angels, and every particular Epiſtle to the Angel; yet it appears there was more than one individual perſon intended thereby<hi>:</hi> as to inſtance, though that Epiſtle to the Church in <hi>Smyrna</hi> be directed to the Angel, yet he ſaith to him; <hi>Behold the Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into Priſon, that ye may be tried and ye ſhall have tribulation, Rev.</hi> 2. 10.

Men may have charity and yet not endure evil-workers, evil and corrupt teachers, or ſuch as are ſeduced and corrupted by them; for charity rejoyceth not in iniquity, but rejoyceth in the truth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 6. ſo <hi>Thyatira</hi> is commended for charity; and yet reproved for ſuffering falſe teachers, [ſee the notes on <hi>v.</hi> 19. and 20.] and they may pity and do good to ſuch as are vitious, polluted perſons in their ways and practiſes, and yet hate their ways, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure intimate fellowſhip with them: hence the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>If thine enemy hunger feed him, If he thirſt give him drink:—</hi>but then Dehorts: <hi>Be not overcome of evil:</hi> Be as kind to them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as you will or can; but ſtill touch no unclean thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 20, 21. Indeed true love and charity worketh no evil to ones neighbour: It leads not to commit Adultery, or to keep company with others in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unfruitful work of darkneſs: It is hatred to our neighbours not to rebuke them (if there be opportunity for it, and they will hear, Prov. 9. 7, 8.) but to ſuffer ſin upon them<hi>:</hi> And much more ſtill it is ſo when we ſtrengthen or countenance them in their evil ways, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8, 10. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 14. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 139. 19, 22</p>

Yea this love is alſo exerciſed in loving and pittying all men; in loving our Enemies, bleſſing them that curſe us, doing good to them that hate us, and praying for them that deſpitefully uſe us: and therefore our Saviour exhorts and inſtructs them that hear, unto theſe things, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 27, 36.

This was the evil reproved and complained of by the Lord in his Church in former times<hi>: They have provoked the holy one of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to anger, they are gone backward, Iſay.</hi> 1. 4. and again; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, this thing commanded I them, ſaying, Obey my voice.—But they hearkened not, nor enclined their ear,—they went backward, and not forward, Jer.</hi> 7. 21, 24. and again; <hi>thou haſt forſaken me, ſaith the Lord, thou art gone backward: therefore I will ſtretch out my hand againſt thee, I am weary with repenting, Jer.</hi> 15. 6. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 23. 8, 12.

Seeing this was the charge he draws up againſt this Angel and Church, let us examine our ſelves whether we be not guilty of this evil alſo: whether there be not a decay and abatement of that heat of love and affection to Jeſus Chriſt, his ſufferings, and the glory which therethorow he is entered into, and poſſeſſed of, and his Goſpel, and people. Say not, we are not guilty hereof; for we have works, and labour, and patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore we are free from this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking evil: for thus Chriſt (and not themſelves) ſaith of theſe.

ſomewhat elſe intended hereby, which will alſo include this, and which leads to the leaving the firſt love, to wit,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Remember <hi>[from whence]</hi> thou art fallen, namely, from the root, principle, and ſeed of thy firſt love<hi>:</hi> that is to ſay, from his firſt love, and the manifeſtation thereof, to wit, the Abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſufferings of Chriſt declared in the Goſpel, in which is evidenced to us the love of God, and that he is love, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 8, 10. and whereby they were begotten to the love of him<hi>:</hi> for <hi>every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God,—for God is love,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 7, 9, 14, 16, 19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2, 4, 5. This kindneſs and love of God to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is the waſhing of regeneration, or laver of the new-birth, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 4, 5. this love of God cauſed them to run well at firſt, even to run unto Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. with <hi>ch.</hi> 1. 6. and <hi>ch.</hi> 5. 7. In the ſufferings and croſs of Chriſt God hath commended, and doth wonderfully and unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly commend his love, his firſt love, to the World of Mankind. <hi>God ſo loved the Word, that he gave his only begotten Son, Joh.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. <hi>God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us, Rom.</hi> 5. 5, 8. And herein the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was admirably demonſtrated, in that he being rich, for our ſakes he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poor; and he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto Death, the Death of the Croſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6, 8.

This is a faithful ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and worthy of all acceptation, that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus came into the World to ſave Sinners,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. and that he was raiſed again for our Juſtification: <hi>We declare unto you glad-tidings,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>How that the Promiſe which was made unto the Fathers, God hath fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame in that he hath raiſed up Jeſus again,</hi> Acts 13. 32, 33.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48916:96"/>
his life, and taſting Death by the Grace of God for every man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. And that this is the fundamental meaning of this <hi>[from whence]</hi> appears, if we conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That upon ſomewhat a like occaſion and account, a like Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel is given to the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> for the recovery thereof<hi>:</hi> Our Lord exhorts and inſtructs that Angel and Church, to <hi>remember how they had received and heard, Rev.</hi> 3. 2, 3. How, not only the manner, but matter alſo; compare <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 18. with <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 24. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 26. to ſignifie unto us; that That Angel and Church had let ſlip and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten what was firſt delivered to them, and received by them; and that their forgetfulneſs thereof was the fundamental cauſe of their dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and evil, as here alſo it was<hi>:</hi> And thereto Chriſt recalls them, that they might ſtrengthen the things that remain, and were ready to dye. [See notes on <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 3.]</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It ſo appears alſo, if it be duly conſidered by us what this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel here given refers to, namely, the latter part of verſe 4. as hath been ſaid, <hi>thou haſt left thy firſt love; remember therefore from whence thou haſt fallen,</hi> which hath occaſioned and cauſed this abatement and leſſening thereof: there is ſome root-iniquity that hath cauſed this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and decay of thy firſt love to him; and that is, thy forgetting his firſt love, and the manifeſtation thereof, So <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It ſo appeareth alſo by this; becauſe he that loveth not (in whole, or in part) knoweth not, conſidereth not God, for God is Love<hi>:</hi> He minds not, or lets ſlip the conſideration hereof, that God is Charity; and that herein is manifeſted the love of God towards us, becauſe that God ſent his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live thorow him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 8, 10. And on the other hand; he that abideth in Chriſt (in the believing mindfulneſs of his being manifeſted, and the end thereof, and his faithfulneſs to him that appointed him;) ſinneth not, miſſeth not his Mark, erres not from his way, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 9. 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. <hi>Whoſo looketh into the perfect Law of Liberty, and continueth therein, he is not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, and ſhall be bleſſed in his Deed,</hi> Jam. 1. 22, 25. <hi>By this ye are ſaved</hi> (to wit, from Sins and Errours) <hi>if ye hold faſt what was preached unto you, unleſs ye have believed in vain:</hi> to wit, how that Chriſt died for our Sins ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, and was buried, and roſe again, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 15. 2, 4. <hi>If that ye have heard from the beginning remain in you, ye alſo ſhall continue in the Son, and in the Father,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 24. By all which it appears, that that from whence they were fallen was, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving view and mindfulneſs of the Croſs of Chriſt, and his firſt love
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48916:96"/>
therein commended. For as a Man cannot heartily love Chriſt, till his love be known and believed; ſo neither will there be a decay or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of the firſt love, until there be ſome departure by an evil heart of unbelief from the Grace of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>2. We come to note ſome Inſtructions from this Branch of the Counſel. As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In general we may note, that when Chriſt's Churches, or any particular Members thereof, have left their firſt-love, and fallen from and forgotten his Sufferings, and his love therein commended; yet he doth not preſently forget them, or their firſt-love to him, or his firſt love to them; but remembers that, and them ſtill, and gives good Counſel to them, while it is called to day, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 1, 3, 31, 32. and <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 1. He calls upon them to return to him from whom they have fallen by their iniquities, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 1, 4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1, 3, 15, 19. He ſtill waits upon ſuch that he may be gracious unto them, <hi>Iſay</hi> 30. 8, 18. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 4, 8. though his well-pleaſed, delightful love towards them ſhould ceaſe or fail; yet while it is the day of his Grace and Patience, while they are joyned to all the living, his compaſſions fail not, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 22, 23. His Charity never faileth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>He is good, for his Mercy endureth for ever, Pſ.</hi> 106. 1, 3. Hence it is that he giveth good and needful Counſel to ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. More particularly from hence we may note and obſerve,</p>
                  <p>1. That thoſe that have been begotten thorow Chriſt's Croſs, and his love therein commended, as declared in the Goſpel, unto the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, and fervent love of him, may fall from their firſt and former high eſteeming and prizing of that precious Blood, and firſt love; they may forget it, and forget how precious it was to them, when it was at firſt proclaimed unto them, and ſeen and believed by them. Thus we may ſee in our Types of old; how much and how oft did the Church of God in former times forget their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was a Type of Chriſt's redeeming us by his Blood; in which God's love was commended to them: <hi>They ſoon forgat his works, and his wonders that he had ſhewed them,</hi> Pſ. 78. 7, 11. <hi>They remembred not the multitude of his Mercies;—they ſoon forgat his works, they waited not for his Counſel.—They ſoon forgat God their Saviour, which had done great things in</hi> Egypt, <hi>wondrous things in the Land of</hi> Ham, Pſ. 106. 7, 13, 21, 22. <hi>Of the Rock that begat them they were unmindful, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat God that formed them,</hi> Deut. 32. 18. Hoſ. 13. 4, 6. and <hi>ch.</hi> 14. 1. And <hi>this is written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the World are come, Heb.</hi> 3. 7, 14. And how guilty of forgetting the preciouſneſs of the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48916:97"/>

                  <p>2. We may further note, that the forgetting the preciouſneſs of Chriſt's Croſs, and the love therein demonſtrated, as declared in the Goſpel, is the cauſe of our departure from Chriſt, and leaving of our firſt-love to him. This appears by the reference this hath to the former verſe; <hi>thou haſt left thy firſt-love, remember therefore,</hi> &amp;c. Thus in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times this is rendred as the cauſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s many evils; their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs of God's wondrous works; as it is ſaid, <hi>How oft did they provoke him in the Wilderneſs, and grieve him in the deſart? yea they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back, and tempted God, and limited the Holy one of Iſrael.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48916:97"/>
from this, in any meaſure, is the cauſe and reaſon of our want, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of love to him. Were this kept in hearty mindfulneſs, we ſhould be preſerved from ſuch decreaſe, or abatement of love, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1, 3. <hi>Chriſt is the living Bread that came down from Heaven: If any Man eat of this Bread he ſhall live for ever: and the Bread which he will give is his Fleſh which</hi> (now) <hi>he hath given for the Life of the World,</hi> Joh. 6. 51, 56, 58.</p>
                  <p>3. The way and means to recover ſuch as are fallen unto, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them in their former and fervent love, is, to put them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what he hath done for them, and how he hath teſtified love to them in their low eſtate. Hence he here ſaith, <hi>Remember.</hi> So <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2, 3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 1, 6. <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh people and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe?—Remember the days of old,</hi> &amp;c.

Theſe things are not only proper and powerful at firſt to reconcile the heart to God, but alſo to recover it from all its wandrings. The Apoſtle therefore puts the <hi>Galatians</hi> in remembrance thereof, when they were removed from him that called them into the Grace of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1, 5. And that any man ſuffers a decay of thoſe things wrought in him is, becauſe he is a forgetful hearer, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 22, 25. The remembring and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he hath done, will be powerful to reſtore us from all our wandrings and out-turnings from him.

Acts</hi> 26. 17, 18, 20. And whereas it is ſaid in the Prophet, of the Men of <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh; God ſaw their works, that they turned from their evil way:</hi> It is thus expreſſed by our Saviour; <hi>They repented at the preaching of Jonas:</hi> To ſhew unto us that repentance includes a turning to God from the evils reproved, <hi>Jona.</hi> 2. 8, 10. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 41. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 22. and <hi>ch.</hi> 9. 20, 21. hence it is called, <hi>Repentance from dead works, Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2.</p>

he ſaith; <hi>repent</hi> and turn from your idols, and turn your faces from all your abominations<hi>: Ezek.</hi> 14. 6. <hi>O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>return unto the Lord thy God, for thou haſt fallen by thine iniquity, Hoſ.</hi> 12. 6. and <hi>ch.</hi> 14. 1. ſo he calls upon them that had left the kindneſs of their youth, the love of their eſpouſals, and ſaith unto them: <hi>Thou haſt played the harlot with many lovers, yet return to me, ſaith the Lord, turn O backſliding Children, ſaith the Lord, for I am married unto you, &amp;c. Jer.</hi> 2. 2. with <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 1, 14, 22. and 4. 1. The like counſel and call he alſo gives to the reſidue of the ſeven Churches, which had ſinned againſt him, or backſliden from him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 16. and <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 3. and <hi>v.</hi> 19. and therefore he calls them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, becauſe he is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. and ſo much he hath both ſaid and ſworn, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live:</hi> And thence calls, and exhorts, <hi>turne ye, turn ye, for why will ye dye, O houſe of Iſrael?

                  <p n="2">2. In that he firſt ſaith to this Angel and Church, <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen,</hi> to wit, from God's grace in Chriſt to ſinners, and then adds, <hi>repent;</hi> ſo he ſignifieth to us, That the believing mindfulneſs, remembrance, and conſideration of the death of Chriſt for ſinners, and of the love of God, his firſt love, therein commended to us, is proper and powerful to work repentance in us not to be repented of: It is <hi>the goodneſs of God that leadeth to repentance, Rom.</hi> 2. 4. It is the Goſpel of Chriſt, the Glad tidings of the Kingdom, that moves men to repent and turn to God. Hence whereas one Evangeliſt ſaith, <hi>The Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and went preaching the Goſpel,</hi> another ſaith, <hi>they went out and preached that Men ſhould repent, Luk.</hi> 9. 2, 6. with <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 13. Thus when <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent, to turn the Jews and Gentiles from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God: and to the end they might repent, and turn to God, he declared the Goſpel to them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none other things than thoſe which the Prophets and <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſay ſhould come to paſs<hi>:</hi> That Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, and that he ſhould be the firſt that ſhould riſe from the dead, and ſhould ſhew light to the people and to the Gentiles<hi>:</hi> In which God's love is firſtly and wonderfully manifeſted, <hi>Acts.</hi> 26. 18, 23. It is the beholding him who hath been crucified for us, as he is evidently ſet forth before our eyes in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that turns the heart to him from all its wandrings and backſlidings &amp; fills it with godly ſorrow: hence it is ſaid; <hi>They ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him as one mourneth for his Son, and ſhall be in bitterneſs for him as one that is in bitterneſs for his firſt born, Zech.</hi> 12. 10, 14. and <hi>ch.</hi> 13. 1. remember therefore, and repent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2, 3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 12, 14. <hi>Joel.</hi> 2. 13, 14.</p>

3. In that he ſaith, <hi>[remember and repent,]</hi> ſo he ſignifieth to us, That the end of our Remembring the Lord's death, and the love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in commended, ſhould be, that we might conſider our ways, and turn our feet to his teſtimnies, wherein ſoever they have been turned therefrom, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 59. we ſhould not ſo remember as they did, of whom it is ſaid; <hi>when he ſlew them then they ſought him, and they remembred that God was their rock (that begat them,) nevertheleſs they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues: For their heart was not right with him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 78. 34, 37. But we ſhould remember his name, that good report given of him, and receive and keep his law, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119 55. We ſhould in ſuch manner, and to ſuch an end remember him, that we might turn to him from all our tranſgreſſions: As the Lord ſaith to his people in former times, <hi>remember theſe (O Jacob and</hi> Iſrael) <hi>for thou art my Servant, I have formed thee, thou art my Servant, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>thou ſhalt not be forgotten of me: I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and as a cloud thy ſins: return unto me, for I have redeemed thee, Iſay.</hi> 44. 21, 22. Thus ſhould we remember the loving-kindneſs of the Lord, that we may repent, and turn unto him, and return to our firſt love, and not ſo remember it, as to abuſe his goodneſs, and turn his grace into Licentiouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1, 3. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 50. 21. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19, 20.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

There is in the name of Chriſt repentance preached to the worſt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, even to Jeruſalem, and ſuch-like heynous tranſgreſſors, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. And God hath exalted Chriſt with his right hand a Prince and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our for to give repentance<hi>:</hi> both the grace of repentance, in turning men from their Iniquities, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 26. and ſpace of Repentance alſo, <hi>Rev</hi> 2. 21. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31. he is ſeaſonably and graciouſly turning ſinners, even backſliding ones alſo, without which they cannot poſſibly repent: As is ſignified in what <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſpeaks<hi>: Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for thou art the Lord my God.

And this ſhews unto us the preciouſneſs of the Blood of Chriſt, and that he hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law<hi>:</hi> It opened no Door of Repentance, but clapt the Curſe upon us: But God hath found out a ranſome; his Juſtice is ſatisfied, and his Truth fulfilled, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10, 13. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 85. 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
                  <p>In that he ſaith before, <hi>[I have againſt thee;]</hi> and after, <hi>[or elſe I will come,</hi> &amp;c.] He ſignifieth to us, that it is of neceſſity that ſuch as have back-ſliden from him, do return from their Iniquity unto him, Otherwiſe it will in concluſion be their ruine<hi>:</hi> They muſt turn or dye, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 30, 32. and <hi>ch.</hi> 33. 11. they muſt come to repentance or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9.

Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table works they are, which flow from unfeigned faith in him, even from the hearty mindfulneſs, and high-prizing of the precious Blood of Chriſt, and the love therein commended to Sinners: It is Faith, even the Word of Faith believed, that worketh by Love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. and

ſo alſo produceth, as the conſequent thereof, good works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 24. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 3, 5. and <hi>ch.</hi> 2. 13. The principle of thoſe works which are acceptable to God, is not our own wiſdom, or any thing in our ſelves, or becauſe it is our duty ſimply, but the Grace of God, his free-love manifeſted in the gift of his Son to be the Saviour of the World, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>The Grace of God that bringeth Salvation to all Men hath appeared, teaching us, that denying <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and Worldly Luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World, Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12.

The firſt works are ſuch as of which Chriſt is the <hi>Omega</hi> and end alſo, and God in him: A Man may do many things good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and yet to a wrong end; it may be to eſtabliſh a Righteouſneſs to himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2, 3. and all ſuch works will not profit or avail to the rendring us acceptable in the ſight of God, <hi>Iſay</hi> 57. 12. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> ſought after Righteouſneſs, as it were by the works of the Law, in which they ſinned againſt the end of the Law, Jeſus Chriſt, and ſtumbled and took offence at that ſtumbling-Stone, and Rock of Offence; not ſubmitting themſelves to the Righteouſneſs of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 30, 31, 33. and <hi>ch.</hi> 10. 1, 4. After ſuch a manner alſo the <hi>Galatians</hi> were ſnared by thoſe Evil-workers that came amongſt them,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48916:100"/>
after they had begun to run well, and were called into the Grace of Chriſt: by liſtening to thoſe Spiritual Witches that came amongſt them, they ſought to perfect by the Fleſh what was begun by the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6. and <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 1. and <hi>ch.</hi> 5. 1, 4. Or the end of what a Man doth may be, that he may have praiſe of Men; as it is with the <hi>Hyppocrites</hi> when they give alms, it is that they may have Glory of Men: when they pray, that they may be ſeen of Men; when they faſt, they ſo do it that they may appear unto Men to faſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 2, 6, 16. And thus our Saviour ſaith of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees; All their works they do for to be ſeen of Men,</hi> Mat. 23. 2, 5. And of this evil end the Apoſtle warns, in ſaying, <hi>Be not deſirous of Vain-glory,</hi> Gal. 5. 26. But now the firſt (or beſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 22.) works are ſuch, as in which a Man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Chriſt hath brought in Everlaſting Righteouſneſs, and that all is prepared in him, he doth therefore in all aim at his Glory; and therein at the good of Men, and eſpecial good of Believers; as the Apoſtle exhorts<hi>: Whether ye eat, or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God. Give none Offence, neither to the</hi> Jews, <hi>nor to the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>nor to the</hi> Church of God<hi>: Even as I pleaſe all Men in all things, not ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be ſaved,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 31, 33. and <hi>ch.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 20, 21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 22.</p>
                  <p>Now from this Branch of the Counſel we may alſo briefly note ſome Inſtructions. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that he had before intimated that they had at firſt, when the Goſpel was preached to, and received by them, a firſt and ſervent love, and now alſo intimates, that they had firſt works; ſo he gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that when God's love in Chriſt to Sinners is ſo known and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that it turns the Heart to him, and begets love unto him; it will alſo produce works, good and acceptable works, ſuch as are well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in his ſight. So much the Apoſtle ſignifies as with reſpect to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Ye received the word of God, which ye heard of us, not as the word of Men, but as it is in truth the word of God, which effectually worketh alſo in you that believe.</hi> It wrought ſo effectually in them, that it wrought Love in them, and the work of Faith, and Labour of Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. with <hi>ch.</hi> 1. 3, 10. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16, 18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that he ſaith, <hi>[And do the firſt works]</hi> ſo he ſignifieth to us, that though there may be works with us, yet not ſuch as are approved of him; nay though they may be right and good in themſelves, yet they may not proceed from the Faith, nor be done in Fervent Love and Charity; nor may we aim at Chriſt, at his Glory, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting

                  <p n="3">3. In that he ſaith, <hi>[Remember and repent, &amp;c.]</hi> ſo he ſignifieth to us; that the way to do the firſt works is to remember Chriſt's works; and to repent and turn to him again from whom we have revolted, and back-ſliden; for as he hath wrought all our works for us, ſo it is he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that muſt work them in us, <hi>Iſay</hi> 26. 12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12, 15. They muſt needs be dead works, imperfect, unacceptable works, unleſs ſuch as have left their firſt love, remember how they have received and heard, and turn from all their wandrings and departures, unto Chriſt again, who is the Green Fir-tree, from whom all good fruit is found, and without whom we can do nothing, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 1, 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 3. The word of the beginning of Chriſt is the Foundation of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from dead works, and of Faith, and of all gracious and ſpiritual Works and Operations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. and <hi>ch.</hi> 9. 14.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In that he adds, <hi>[And do the firſt works,]</hi> after the two former Branches of the Counſel; ſo we may learn, that we ſhould not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply remember and repent, but alſo bring forth Fruits meet for, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to ſuch remembrance and repentance<hi>:</hi> as the Baptiſt ſaith to the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadducees, Mat.</hi> 3. 7, 8. So the Apoſtle ſhewed firſt to them of <hi>Damaſcus, &amp;c.</hi> that they ſhould repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 19, 20. God is indeed firſt working in us both to will, and to do of good pleaſure: But ſtill ſomewhat is required of us as he is thus preventing us; namely, <hi>to do all things without murmurings and diſputings,</hi> Phil. 2. 13, 15.

                  <p>1. There are perſonal comings of his, and they are two:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His coming down from Heaven to be made and manifeſted in the Fleſh, and to be further abaſed for us, that he might deliver us from that ſo great a Death as in which otherwiſe we muſt have periſhed for ever<hi>:</hi> And that he might obtain for us Life and immortality; ſo, <hi>when the fulneſs of the time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law, that he might redeem them that were under the Law.</hi> And, <hi>he came down from Heaven, not to do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him,</hi> Gal. 4, 4, 5. Joh. 6. 40. So according to the end of his Father's Miſſion he came into the World to be made Man; wherefore when he cometh into the World, he ſaith,<hi>—A Body haſt thou prepared me,</hi> Heb. 10. 5. And <hi>once in the end of the World he appeared to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf,</hi> Heb. 9. 26. <hi>He was manifeſted to take away our Sins, and make peace for us,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 5. Col. 1. 20. 1 Joh. 4. 9, 10. <hi>And to that end he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs,</hi> Phil. 2. 6, 8. aſwell as alſo, He came to preach peace in a frail and mortal body, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18, 43. And to ſeal to the truth of the Goſpel by his Blood, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 37. And as with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to both ends he came to be a Saviour, to ſave that which was loſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 11. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 47. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 54, 56. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. So, and in this conſideration he hath come once, and ſhall come no more, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 10, 28. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 9, 10. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And he ſhall come again, and appear the ſecond time, in his own perſonal body; not in abaſement and weakneſs as formerly, but in Glory; in his own Glory, and in the Glory of his Father, with all his Holy Angels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 27. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 26. <hi>He ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the Voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the Trump of God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 16. But of neither of theſe two perſonal comings doth this place ſpeak. [See the Notes before on <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 7.]</p>
                  <p>2. There are other comings of Chriſt ſpoken of in ſcripture, which are not perſonal, but inviſible, ſpiritual, and providential comings of his; that is to ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:48916:102"/>
1. His comings in his mercies, word, and ordinances, &amp; in his gracious viſitations of mens hearts and ſpirits<hi>:</hi> ſo before he took our nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he was in the World, and came unto his own in the miniſtery of of his Prophets, Joh. 1. 10, 11. Thus it is ſaid: <hi>Wherefore when I came was there no man, when I called was there none to anſwer, &amp;c.</hi> that is, he came in his word and called, and knocked, that they might have opened, and given entertainment to him, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 50. 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. And the Lord ſaith; <hi>In all places where I record my name, I will come unto thee, &amp;c. Exod.</hi> 20. 24. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 20. And, <hi>If any man love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him, Joh.</hi> 14. 21, 23. But of his thus coming he here ſpeaks not neither. [ſee notes on <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 20.]</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is alſo ſaid to come judicially, to execute judgments, now in this day: either to take men away out of this World by death, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith: <hi>Be ye ready, for the Son of Man cometh at an hour when ye think not, Luke</hi> 12. 40. <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 35. or to execute and inflict ſome judgment here, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 16. and <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 3. and <hi>ch.</hi> 16. 15. or to take away, and remove ſome mercies he hath been vouch-ſafing to any<hi>:</hi> thus we are here to underſtand it. So it is ſaid; <hi>The Lord cometh out of his place to puniſh, Iſay</hi> 26. 21. <hi>Mica.</hi> 1. 3. So he that is in the Heavens in his perſonal body, can come unto us in his providences and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments when he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quickly.]</hi> that is, 1. Eaſily, lightly, without difficulty, if men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 39. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 28. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24, 29. 2. <hi>Quickly.]</hi> without delay, ſpeedily<hi>:</hi> ſo <hi>v.</hi> 16. he would haſten his word to perform it, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 12. 3. <hi>Quickly]</hi> unexpectedly, and unthought of; and ſo he would come as a thief, when they were not aware, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his mercy from them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 3. and <hi>ch.</hi> 16. 15.</p>
                  <p>Now in that he thus threatens to come to this Angel and Church, we may learn,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he on whom we call is one that is without partiality in his judgments: he is ſuch an one as without reſpect of perſons judgeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto every man's work. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17.

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="1">1.

The candleſtick is the place in which the light is ſet; and by removing the former, he would deprive them alſo of the latter, and take away from them thoſe gifts, and that knowledge that had been vouchſafed to them, and not improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them<hi>:</hi> as our ſaviour ſaith, <hi>From him that hath not ſhall be taken away even that which he hath, Mat.</hi> 13. 12.

                  <p n="2">2. It is an iniquity, to the motioning, perpetrating, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting whereof, there is ordinarily more deliberation, and pre-meditation, than in the acting other evils: with many other ſins men may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken and ſurprized at unawares, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. but in committing this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination, men do uſually ſin deliberately and preſumptuouſly: and therefore it is more provoking to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is an inſective and hurtful evil to others<hi>:</hi> One alone may be guilty of, and commit another evil: But here, a ſecond at leaſt is pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. yea and hereby uſually many are defiled, <hi>Heb.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. It is a more blemiſhing and diſhonouring evil then many other when it is known to others; and uſually God brings it to light<hi>:</hi> It brings a blemiſh upon the name of God which is called upon them, and made mention of by them: as the Apoſtle ſaith, The name of God is blaſphemed thorow you among the gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 22, 24. It gives occaſion to the adverſary to ſpeak reproachfully, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 14. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 10, 14. and it brings a perpetual diſhonour upon thoſe who are polluted with this iniquity: <hi>A wound and diſhonour ſhall he get, and his reproach ſhall not be wiped away, Prov.</hi> 6. 32, 33. <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. 23.</p>

So whereas the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is here charged to have left her firſt-love; and threatned, that if ſhe remembers not from whence ſhe is fallen, and repents not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He will remove her candleſtick: Though this be ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the Church directly, yet the ſame charge and commination reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects every particular perſon that is alike guilty: and the ſame judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or one of a like nature, is to be feared, if it be not timely prevented.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We come in the next place to note ſome inſtructions briefly:—. As to ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the way for us to hear and underſtand theſe things here written to the Churches, is to hear continually the word of Jeſus, even the word of the beginning of Chriſt, which is the foundation of all graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſpiritual operations, and of all doctrines, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundantly, Mat.</hi> 13. 12. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 20, 24, 27.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Herein is ſuppoſed, that ſuch as have an ear may not hear, attend unto, and mind theſe things ſpoken to the Churches: It is poſſible, that they which have ears to hear, may not hear: they may not improve what they are furniſhed with, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 21. ſo much our Saviour ſignifies when he ſaith to his diſciples, <hi>Perceive ye not, neither underſtand? have ye your hearts yet hardned? having eyes ſee ye not? and having ears hear ye not? And do ye not yet Remember? Mark.</hi> 8. 17, 18. Where he both gives us to underſtand, who they are that have ears, to wit, his diſciples: and alſo ſignifies, that ſuch may not hear: they may pretend or ſuppoſe ſo much difficulty in the Book of this prophecy, as not to mind or ſet their hearts to what is contained therein; or upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accounts may not make uſe of, or improve that ear which they have received, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22, 23.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That it is the gracious mind of our Lord Jeſus, that every one
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48916:109"/>
that hath an ear ſhould hear the things here written to the Churches: that they ſhould attentively hear and underſtand them; as the Word <hi>[hear]</hi> when it's mentioned alone, doth frequently ſignify <hi>[underſtand] Mat.</hi> 13. 18. [ſee notes on <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 3.] The things herein written are therefore ſent and written, not for the ſakes of the Angels, and Churches as congregated together only: But it is the good will of Chriſt, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular Man that hath an ear ſhould hear them alſo; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any ſuch may with encouragement hear, that he may underſtand.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is of concernment, and great uſefulneſs to ſuch an one, to hear and conſider what is here ſpoken, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider we next the thing that every ſuch an one is called upon to hear: And that is, <hi>[what the ſpirit ſaith unto the Churches:]</hi> not to the World only, All may hear that, as before is ſaid, but unto the Churches.</p>
                  <p>What is that? Surely we may ſay, all ſpoken to them: and ſo as with reſpect to what is ſaid directly to this Church, he is to hear all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken, to wit, the deſcription Chriſt gives of himſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 1. the commendable things found with this Angel and Church: to receive the grace of God, to imitate what is good, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 6.

                  <p>5. They have weapons to fight withal for the Faith againſt their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual enemies, both defenſive and offenſive; armour of righteouſneſs on the right hand and on the left is prepared for them, and to be put on by them; that being therewith armed, they might not turn back in the day of battle, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 78. 9. and the weapons of their warfare are not carnal, not material and outward ſwords and bows, or ſuch-like wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons<hi>:</hi> for alas theſe are weak, and their enemies will deride at them: but their weapons are ſpiritual, and ſo mighty thorow God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. not by might, nor by power, but by the ſpirit of the Lord of hoſtes, they may do valiantly: thorow him they may puſh down their enemies: thorow his name they may tread them under that riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 6, 7. the good fight is the fight of faith, that is that which is to be fought for, as is before ſaid<hi>:</hi> and that is that which is to be fought with<hi>: whatſoever is born of God overcometh the world, and this is the victory that overcometh the World, even our faith,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 4, 5. <hi>The Goſpel of Chriſt is the power of God to ſalvation, to every one that believeth, Rom.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
                  <p>6. They have a crown propoſed to, and ſet before them to engage, and encourage them to play the men, &amp; to oppoſe and fight againſt their enemies, even unto blood. Men that here fight they do it for a fading reward, they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible. <hi>I therefore ſo run not as uncertainly: ſo fight I, not as one that beats the ayre: But I have fought the good fight,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,—I have kept the Faith, But I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 26, 27. <hi>henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord the Righteous judge will give me at that day: And not to me only, but to all them alſo that love his appearing,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7, 8.

But too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for want of faith in God, when perſons are poor, they withhold more then is meet, and it tendeth to poverty. Wee may ſee what no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice our Saviour takes of the poor Widow, that caſt in two mites into the treaſury: <hi>He ſaid, of a truth I ſay unto you, that this poor widow hath caſt in more then they all: For theſe all have of their abundance caſt into the offerings of God; but ſhe of her penury hath caſt in all the living that ſhe had, Luke</hi> 21. 1, 4.

Thus again the Apoſtle ſignifies ſuch to be <hi>Jews</hi> indeed or of the circumciſion, who are ſincere Chriſtians, and circumciſed in heart, when he ſaith; <hi>Finally, Brethren rejoyce in the Lord;—Beware of the conciſion;</hi> For we are the circumciſion, which worſhip God in the ſpirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh. They are the circumciſion and ſo <hi>Jews</hi> indeed, who count all things loſs for Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 1, 3, 7, 9. So again the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>In Chriſt ye are compleat;</hi> no, ſay the natural <hi>Jews</hi> and Judaizers; ye are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in Chriſt, for ye are not circumciſed; yes ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ye have circumciſion in Chriſt alſo; in whom ye are circumciſed with the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh by the circumciſion of Chriſt, Col.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 8, 13. and <hi>ch.</hi> 11. 17, 18.

1. Becauſe in this Book great and frequent reſpect is had to our types of old, and to their places and perſons<hi>:</hi> and thoſe names which were uſual amongſt them, are frequently made uſe of in this Book of the Revelation<hi>:</hi> So our Jeſus, our great High-prieſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in viſion in the habit of the High-prieſt under the law, <hi>ch.</hi> 1. 13. and thoſe that ſerve God in his Temple day and night are clothed like the Prieſts in former times, <hi>ch.</hi> 7. 13, 15. with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. 12, 13. Thus we read of the temple often, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with alluſion to the typical one: and the Ark of the teſtimony, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 19. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. 33, 34.

The altar, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 9. and many other Inſtances might be given, which may be taken notice of as we come at them, God willing and aſſiſting<hi>:</hi> and therefore ſuch reſpect being had ſo frequently to the Jewiſh perſons, places, names, in this Book, (as alſo when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle writes to the Hebrews:) Jews may here ſignify, the ſincere, or pure Chriſtians, as alſo in <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe alſo, this Book appears to be received after the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and then it would be no wiſdom at all, but an High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point of folly and impudence to ſay, they were <hi>Jews,</hi> in the common acceptation, and were not ſo: for by ſo doing they did expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to drink of the ſame cup with thoſe who were <hi>Jews</hi> by nature. It would be more prudence, in ſuch a time, for thoſe who were <hi>Jews</hi> to ſay they were none, and to call themſelves by another name, to take away their reproach, <hi>Iſay</hi> 4. 1. then for ſuch as were no <hi>Jews</hi> to call themſelves by that name; unleſs they deſired death rather then life, which cannot reaſonably be ſuppoſed: [ſee the notes on <hi>v.</hi> 13. of this chapter.]</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe <hi>[Jews]</hi> are in this place, and alſo in <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 9. oppoſed to the Synagogue of Satan<hi>:</hi> now they might be <hi>Jews</hi> in the common no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and yet alſo be the Synagogue of Satan, or, of the Synagogue of Satan: as our Saviour ſaith to ſome Jews; <hi>ye are of your Father the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and the luſts of your Father ye will do, Joh.</hi> 8. 44. but now un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. It appears alſo, that by <hi>[Jews</hi> [here, are not meant Jews by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but hearty believers in Chriſt: Becauſe they did blaſpheme true
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48916:122"/>
Chriſtians, as the natural Jews might do, and did generally, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 45. and <hi>ch.</hi> 18. 6. now if they ſaid they were <hi>Jews</hi> by nature, and yet blaſphemed Chriſt's diſciples, both theſe might conſiſt together, and they might ſpeak truly enough, which our Saviour ſaith they did not: But now pretending themſelves to be ſpiritual <hi>Jews,</hi> &amp; blaſpheming ſuch as were ſo indeed, they herein appeared to be liars, and to ſpeak falſely.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This further appears, probably, becauſe in <hi>v.</hi> 10. theſe falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders did proceed judicially againſt the Chriſtians: or our Saviour foretels they would ſo do; which is not very likely the <hi>Jews</hi> by nature ſhould do, ſeeing <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was deſtroyed already, as hath been ſaid, and may be ſhewn in the notes on <hi>v.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We come nextly to ſhew, what is meant by their <hi>[Blaſphemy.]</hi> and to that we ſay: Blaſphemy in general doth ſignify an evil, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful ſpeaking of, or againſt any one; or a ſtriking thorow with words: and ſo the word <hi>[Blaſphemy]</hi> is ſometimes tranſlated, evil, or curſed ſpeaking, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 31. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 8. ſlandering, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8. defam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. railing, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 2. and ſo</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of Blaſphemy, God, Chriſt, or the Holy Spirit is the object<hi>:</hi> and ſo ſometimes by blaſphemy is meant Idolatry, as when men give the honour due to God to an Idol, or ſomething beſides him: ſo it is ſaid; <hi>your iniquities, and the iniquities of your Fathers together (ſaith the Lord) which have burnt incenſe upon the mountains, and [blaſphemed] me upon the hills, Iſay</hi> 65. 7. ſee alſo, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 27, 31. or, they are guilty of blaſphemy, who give not to God the honour due to him, but ſpeak re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully and diſhonourably of him; ſo <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> blaſphemed the the Lord<hi>:</hi> compare, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 29, 37. with <hi>ch.</hi> 19. 6, 22. And ſo they are blaſphemers, or guilty of blaſphemy, who ſpeak reproachfully of Chriſt and his Goſpel, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. with <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 9. or who ſpeak againſt the holy ſpirit<hi>:</hi> compare, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 31, 32. with <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 10. or who arrogate to themſelves that which is peculiarly due to God, Chriſt, or the holy Spirit<hi>:</hi> as the man of ſin evidently doth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 1, 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>ch.</hi> 26. 65. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 33, 34, 35, 36.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And here by <hi>[blaſphemy]</hi> may alſo be meant, reproaching, reviling and vilifying the true diſciples of Chriſt, and perſecuting them; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo appears in the next verſe to this: ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith; <hi>they think it ſtrange that you run not with them to the ſame exceſs of riot, blaſpheming you,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 4. And indeed when his diſciples are reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and perſecuted he takes it as done to himſelf: hence it is ſaid; <hi>If ye be reproached for the name of Chriſt, happy are ye: for the ſpirit of glory and of God reſteth upon you:</hi> on their part he is blaſphemed when his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48916:123"/>
are reproached, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 12, 14. Hence alſo Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? Acts</hi> 9. 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 40. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 83. 2, 5.</p>
                  <p>Now from this part of the verſe as thus opened, we may note,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That thoſe that are not Chriſtians indeed, may yet pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the moſt orthodox Chriſtians, though they are not ſo, but guilty of blaſphemy, Idolatry, and many great evils: ſo now in theſe days in which we live, ſuch as worſhip ſtocks and ſtones, the work of mens hands, and Saints departed, and ſo are guilty of blaſphemy; yet give forth themſelves to be the only true and catholick Church, and that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are hereticks, that joyn not with, but oppoſe them, and their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, ſuperſtitions, and Antichriſtian, and humane Inventions, traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and impoſitions. And indeed this myſtery of iniquity began to work in the Apoſtles days; and before this Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> was ſent and ſignified to <hi>John,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 7. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 18. and ſuch were theſe pretenders here ſpoken of, even Antichriſtian Idolatrous ones: this Synagogue of Satan was <hi>myſtery-Babylon</hi> in its infancy and beginning; and not the Gnoſtick-hereticks only, as ſome would have it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That ſuch as ſaid they were <hi>Jews,</hi> and were not, ſuch as gave forth themſelves to be the beſt and trueſt Chriſtians, did yet reproach, blaſpheme, and perſecute ſuch as were Chriſts diſciples indeed, and ſo their better Brethren; as it was formerly, ſo it is now<hi>: your Brethren,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>that hated you, that caſt you out for my name ſake, ſaid, let the Lord be glorified, Iſay</hi> 66. 5. that is, they did pretend to do God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and glorify him, when they excommunicated his righteous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; they pretended themſelves to be right worſhippers, and lookt upon, and dealt with ſuch as were ſo indeed, as hereticks and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks; as alſo is elſewhere ſignified by the ſame Prophet, where he ſaith; <hi>yea truth faileth, and he that departeth from evil maketh himſelf a prey,</hi> or, is counted mad, a Phanatick <hi>&amp;c. Iſay</hi> 59. 15 with <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 1, 2. and this was one great iniquity in <hi>Judah</hi> formerly, and found amongſt the leaders of the people alſo, who were confident they were in the right way; and it was one great cauſe of thoſe heavy judgments that were executed upon them; <hi>For the ſin of her Prophets and the iniquity of her priests, that ſhed the blood of the just in the midst of her, Lam.</hi> 4 13. thus alſo it was in the Apoſtles time; there were then falſe brethren, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 4. and they have forewarned, that ſuch as ſhould have a form of godlineſs upon them, would deny the power thereof, and be deſpiſers of ſuch as were good, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 3, 5. and thus it hath been ſince too e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. any Man whoſe eyes are opened may ſee the truth
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48916:123"/>
of this<hi>:</hi> That thoſe who reckon themſelves, and ſay they are the moſt Catholick, or orthodox Chriſtians; and who call all that diſſent from them, and are oppoſers of them in their evil principles, doctrines, and practices, Hereticks, Sectaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are yet enemies to, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their Brethren, and like to <hi>Cain,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe fair pretenders were not ſuch as they gave forth themſelves to be, but the Synagogue of Satan. Too oft it comes to paſs, that where Chriſt hath his Church, Satan hath his Synagogue, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 9. Theſe were ſuch, it ſeems, as though they pretended themſelves to be the only ſincere Chriſtians; yet were indeed congregated by Satan, and did worſhip him: <hi>The God of this World did blind their minds,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. And they were adverſaries to God's people, and therein of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 18.

1. The warning and caution which he gives unto this Angel and Church; <hi>[Fear none of thoſe things which thou ſhalt ſuffer:]</hi> here we may note ſome things ſignified to us,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that he ſignifieth that they were in tribulation, <hi>v.</hi> 9. and here and after gives us to underſtand, that they were ſtill to ſuffer, and be in tribulation, ſo we may receive this Inſtruction: That while they are in this World tribulation is to be expected by the believers; one affliction ſucceeding and following upon the neck of another: <hi>Many are the afflictions of the righteous,</hi> Pſ. 34. 19. <hi>In the World ye ſhall have tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 33. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 12. As it was with <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> of old, ſo it is true of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God: <hi>Many a time have they afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me from my youth, may</hi> Iſrael <hi>now ſay: many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: The plowers plowed upon my back, they made long their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, Pſ.</hi> 129. 1, 3. The believers are now hated of all men for Chriſt's name-ſake: And when permiſſive commiſſion is given to their enemies they will be inſtruments of affliction and grievance to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 22. now they ſow in tears, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 126. 5, 6. yea many afflictions they meet withal from ſuch as pretend themſelves to be, and would be accounted the moſt ſincere Chriſtians, as we have ſeen in <hi>v.</hi> 9. and this ſhews, that here is not their reſt: they are not yet perfect as to attainment, <hi>Iſay</hi> 14. 3. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 5, 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 3, 4, 5. and alſo we may learn from hence, that we cannot know love or hatred by any thing here: they may be loved peculiarly that are in troubles frequently: and they may be hated comparatively, and woes denounced againſt them that are at eaſe in Zion, <hi>Amos.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73. 2, 12. and 11. 5, 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5, 7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that he ſaith to theſe; <hi>[Fear none of thoſe things, &amp;c.]</hi> ſo he ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to us: That even the believers themſelves are liable to fear, timerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and cowardice, aſwell as others, and need to be admoniſhed thereof, and ſtrengthened there-againſt; yea and the beſt and moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of them alſo: ſuch were this Angel and Church; for our Saviour faults them for nothing; and yet gives this caution to them<hi>:</hi> ſuch a like caution our Saviour gives unto his diſciples generally: <hi>Fear not little flock, Luke</hi> 12. 32. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was not aſhamed to remember and acknowledge to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> that he was with them in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in fear, and in much trembling, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 13, 14. [ſee the notes on <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 17.] We have fear in us as a natural infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the fleſh, and are ſubject and ready to pollute our ſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and to be under the power thereof; and therefore we need to be warned there-againſt, and to receive admonition.—And in general we may note, that ſeeing this admonition is given to ſuch as were blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unreprovable in his ſight; That ſuch perſons as do not ſin at
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48916:124"/>

                     </gap>ideration, that believers are now liable to fear, might be uſeful to us; That we ſhould not be diſcouraged, or deſpond, becauſe we are ſometimes fearful; but to remember that holy ones were ſubject thereto formerly.—and we might therefore learn to pity one another: and not to truſt, or glory in our ſelves, or in other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We may further note from hence; that ſuch as have been in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and affliction formerly, and have behaved themſelves unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveably therein, may yet fear when a new trouble and trial comes upon them: ſee <hi>v.</hi> 9. ſo much alſo the Apoſtle intimates when he writes to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and ſaith: <hi>call to remembrance the former days, in which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ye were illuminated ye endured a great fight of affliction: partly whileſt ye were made a gazing-stock both by reproaches and afflictions: and partly whileſt ye became companions of them that were ſo uſed, for ye had compaſſion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the ſpoiling of your goods.</hi> But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this it appears, that though they had ſo well behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves formerly in afflictions, they were afterwards ready to fear, and needed to be warned thereof<hi>:</hi> hence to the former he adds, Caſt not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward, for ye have need of patience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 32, 36. ſuch as have in former times patiently endured, and not feared, need to be again encouraged and ſtrengthened, and ſtirred up to courage, when a new trial is ordered to them. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy: Fight the good fight of faith; lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art called, and haſt profeſſed a good profeſſion before many witneſſes,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 12, 14. <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 9, 10. with <hi>ch.</hi> 13. 51, 52. and 14. 1, 21. and <hi>ch.</hi> 23. 11.

Fear not want, nor enemies. Some may think, they could endure reproach, or evil words, but not bodily perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution<hi>:</hi> ſome may endure impriſonment, but not ſpoiling of their goods: ſome may chearfully undergo all but death<hi>:</hi> Some, ſuch a kind of death, but not another which may be more painful, or ſhameful: but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing we may ſuffer ſhould be feared<hi>:</hi> as he ſaith; <hi>I will fear none evil, Pſ.</hi> 23. 4.

former perſecuting the Saints, ſaith; <hi>and many of the Saints did I ſhut up in priſon, having received authority from the chief prieſts, &amp;c. Acts</hi> 26. 10. In which we may take notice,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That all power is given to Chriſt both in Heaven, and on earth: certainly the Devil and his Inſtruments would, if they could, deſtroy Chriſt's diſciples root and branch, as it is ſaid<hi>: They have taken crafty counſel againſt thy people, and conſulted againſt thine hidden ones: they have ſaid, come, and let us cut them off from being a nation, that the name of</hi> Iſrael <hi>may be no more in remembrance,</hi> Pſ. 83. 3, 4. <hi>If it had not been the Lord who was on our ſide, now may</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſay, they had ſwallowed us upquick, when their wrath was kindled againſt us, Pſ.</hi> 124. 1, 3, 7.

                  <p n="2">2. We may herein alſo ſee and take notice of God's pitty towards the congregation of his poor. It is a great mercy that ſome are free and at liberty, that they may viſit, and extend kindneſs to their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who are in affliction, and under reſtraint; as the Apoſtle exhorts, ſaying, <hi>Remember them that are in bonds as bound with them, and them that ſuffer adverſity as being your ſelves alſo in the body, Heb.</hi> 13. 1, 3. And our Saviour will ſay to the righteous at the laſt day, <hi>I was an hungred and ye gave me meat; I was thirſty and ye gave me drink; I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in;—I was in priſon and ye came unto me,</hi> to wit, to him in his members and Brethren: in which is ſignified; that when ſome were deſtitute of daily food and in priſon, otherſome had wherewith to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their wants, and were at liberty to viſit them; and ſuch as were led by his ſpirit, and did not ſhut up the bowels of their compaſſion, did thus exerciſe themſelves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34, 40.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have next to ſpeak unto the end why they ſhould be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſon, <hi>[that ye may be tried;]</hi> It is not ſaid only, that he, the Devil may try you, but indefinitely that ye may be tried; both that Satan might try them, yea and that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt might try them alſo, though upon a different account, and to a different end: and ſo we may ſay a little particularly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon when he is permitted, that he may tempt and try you; and indeed his work and end in and by himſelf and inſtruments, is, to uſe all means, if poſſible, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them from the way of the Lord; he doth tempt them to evil, and thruſts ſore at them that they might fall.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48916:127"/>
and <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>The prince of this World came, but had nothing in him, Joh.</hi> 14. 30. <hi>Chriſt was in all points tempted like unto us, yet without ſin, Heb.</hi> 4. 14. and thus will he do to his followers, as he did to their captain, even tempt them to all that is evil, and to turn them away from the truth: hence the Apoſtle was ſo careful of, and watchful over the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> and ſent to know their faith, leſt by ſome means the tempter had tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and their labour were in vain, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 1, 5. Eſpecially in times of tribulation and affliction he is tempting; he knows how irkſome perſecution is to us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. and he is therefore trying whether he can turn them aſide who are going right on their way; telling them, that in letting go their faith or the profeſſion thereof, and having fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with others in their unfruitful works of darkneſs, they ſhall have their lives continued to them, and live happily and merrily, and have all that heart can wiſh, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35. <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 6, or on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, threatning further troubles and loſs of liberty, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 11. 36. or elſe tempting them to impatience and fretfulneſs, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord, and thoſe that are inſtruments of affliction to them, or to envy their fulneſs, proſperity, eaſe, <hi>&amp;c. Iſay</hi> 8. 19, 21. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 37. 1, 8. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 17, 18. And we are to apt to liſten to him, to ſave our lives: hence our Saviour ſaith unto his diſciples, <hi>whoſoever will ſave his life ſhall loſe it: But whoſoever will loſe his life for my name ſake ſhall find it, Mat</hi> 16. 23, 25. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 25, 26.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

But when he orders trials unto us, and comes to prove us, we appear then to be other manner of perſons than we formerly thought our ſelves to be: As it is ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah; God left him to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart, then he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be another Man than he thought himſelf to have been,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 25, 31. with <hi>Iſay</hi> 38. 3.

                  <p n="2">2. And he doth try alſo, even purify and purge them from their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and pollutions that cleave to them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 35. and thus alſo he tries them as the Goldſmith doth his mettall, when he throws it into the fire, namely, refines it. as it is ſaid; <hi>I will bring the third part tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the fire, and will refine them as ſilver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried, Zech.</hi> 13. 9.

                  <p>We have ſpoken to all the former part of this <hi>v.</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 7. foredirected to: and ſhall only ſpeak ſomewhat to this laſt clauſe, which is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of every one that overcometh, low and high, rich and poor, wiſe and unwiſe together<hi>: [he ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond death.]</hi> In which is intimated and ſignified to us,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he may be hurt, or injured of the firſt death<hi>:</hi> I mean, he may have his life taken away injuriouſly from him: And ſo before that, he may have his goods taken away, and be ſpoiled of them; and he may be perſecuted both by reproachful words, and alſo actually ſo, and be chaſed from friends, and habitations, and be deprived of his liberty, and caſt into, and kept in priſon, and be ſeverely handled, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly, and deſpitefully uſed, as we have ſeen before on <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. which perſecutions the Apoſtle calls, killing, and deaths, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35, 36. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 30, 31. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 10, 12. and <hi>ch.</hi> 11. 23. In ſuch reſpects they may be hurt; as it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 5. If any Man will hurt, or injure them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth,—And if any Man will hurt, or injure them, he muſt in this manner be killed, <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 10. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 35. 4, 26. So the Prophet ſaith<hi>: they that ſeek my hurt ſpeak miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous things, and imagine deceits all the day long, Pſ.</hi> 38. 12. Tribulation and affliction are hurtful to the outward Man, and very grievous, even reproach is ſo, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 69. 20. And much rather, to be impriſoned, and ſpoiled of the things appertaining to the natural life<hi>:</hi> or to be tortured or injuriouſly condemned, and put to death<hi>:</hi> Thus they may be hurt of the firſt death, while they are in their warfare, and even to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation, or concluſion thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. If any one ſhould ſay; It appears none can, or will hurt them, from that queſtion of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter's: who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer: That doth not ſuppoſe that none will harm them, or vex them, or evilly entreat them: But either,</p>

1. Who is he that will do it? namely, what, or who is he as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Lord, whoſe eyes are over them? who is he that will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy himſelf in ſuch a work? <hi>v.</hi> 12. like that which the Prophet ſpeaks in the perſon of Chriſt<hi>:</hi> he is neer that Juſtifieth me, who will contend with me? who is mine adverſary? <hi>Behold the Lord God will help me, who is he that ſhall condemn me? Iſay.</hi> 50. 7, 9. which words imply not, that Chriſt had no adverſary, or none to contend with, or condemn him; But that they were inconſiderable, and not worthy to be taken notice of, in compariſon of the Lord GOD, who juſtified, and helpt him. In ſuch a like ſenſe we may alſo underſtand that: <hi>If God be for us, Who can be againſt us? Rom.</hi> 8. 31, 39. Or,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Who is he that will harm you?</hi> What manner of perſons are they? none but vile perſons, and ſuch as have cauſe to be aſhamed of their deeds; ſuch as are unaccountable, or can give no good account for what they do, abſurd, unreaſonable Men, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13, 16. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 3. In both theſe ſenſes we may take it: But not as if they might not harm them in the ſenſe we are ſpeaking of<hi>:</hi> they may evilly entreat, and injure them: and ſo much is implied in the next verſe<hi>: But and if ye do ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake, happy are ye. And be not afraid of their terrour, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13, 14. And though God will bring good out of evil, and cauſe all to work together for good to them that love God, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 8. 28. yet ſtill, wickedneſs proceedeth from the wicked, and that is no thank to their enemies, that he cauſeth the wrath of man to praiſe him; nor do they mean ſo, <hi>Iſay</hi> 10. 5, 7. nor is this the way to effect it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 19, 20, 21. So that ſtill it appears, that now of the firſt death they may be injured, or hurt, in the ſence that is before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: and as is intimated in theſe words.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But that which is here affirmed is, <hi>[he ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond death.]</hi> Where let us inquire and conſider for our uſefulneſs.</p>
                  <p>What is this <hi>ſecond death?]</hi> To which we may ſay more Generally<hi>:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is called the ſecond death with reſpect to Men, not to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and his Angels: for it is that which was at firſt prepared for them who kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitation, and unto which they are reſerved in everlaſting chains of darkneſs to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great day, <hi>Mat,</hi> 25. 41. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Jude</hi> 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 10, 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And therefore it appears; The ſecond death is not that which was threatned againſt man, in caſe he eat of the forbidden fruit. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God ſaid, <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, in dying thou ſhalt dye, Gen.</hi> 2. 17. But <hi>this death Chriſt hath taſted for every Man, Heb.</hi> 2. 9. And
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48916:132"/>
aboliſhed it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. Otherwiſe we muſt have periſhed in it for ever: our ſpirits ſhould have been baniſhed from the favour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and our bodies turned to, and remained in corruption: there had been no reſurrection of the dead, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 20, 22. But this death, as is ſaid, Chriſt hath overcome, and aboliſhed. And thus it is appointed to Men once to dye, namely, this firſt death, as Chriſt hath taken the ſting out of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. and in due time all ſhall be raiſed out of it, and no man ſhall periſh in it for ever: and in due time alſo he will deſtroy it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 28, 29. <hi>Act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But now, the ſecond death here ſpoken of more particularly is that,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Which ſhall be executed on Men, not for their ſinning in <hi>Adam,</hi> nor for their partaking neceſſarily of filth and pollution; but for their own perſonal Sinnings againſt light and grace vouchſafed, and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them thorow the one and on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. Their Judge, and he that ſhall condemn them, and adjudge them to the ſecond death, will be the Lord Jeſus, who died, and roſe for them. God hath ordained him the Judge of quick and dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 42. and <hi>ch.</hi> 17. 30, 31. <hi>We muſt all appear before the judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether good or bad,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10, 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 30, 41. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22, 27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Iſay</hi> 45. 22, 23, 24.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The rule according to which he will judge them will be, not the law as they fell under it in <hi>Adam,</hi> but the Goſpel. So the Apoſtle ſaith,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48916:132"/>
both as with reſpect to them that have ſinned without the law, or Doctrine of the Lord; and as with reſpect to them that have ſinned in the law, <hi>That God ſhall judg the ſecrets of them by Jeſus Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpel, Rom.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 16, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 47, 50. <hi>Iſay.</hi> 30. 33.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The time when they ſhall be adjudged to this ſecond death will be, after they are raiſed out of the firſt: after that the Judgment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2, 3. and <hi>ch.</hi> 6. 27. <hi>All that are in the graves ſhall hear the voice of the Son of Man, and ſhall come forth, they that have done evil to the reſurrection of damnation, Joh.</hi> 5. 28, 29. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 14, 16. It is therefore called, <hi>the wrath to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 8, 10.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It will be ſo dreadful and terrible both on Soul and Body, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28. that there will be no mixture of mercy in it: now in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red. It is full of mixture and he poureth out of the ſame: but the dreggs thereof all the wicked of the earth ſhall wring out, and drink, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 75. 8. they ſhall not then have ſo much as a drop of water to cool their tongues, when they are tormented in that flame, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 24, 25, 26. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 10. yea then the Lord will laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear cometh: When their fear cometh as deſolation, and their deſtruction as a whirlewind; when diſtreſs and anguiſh cometh upon them; then they ſhall call upon him, but he will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek him early but they ſhall not find him; for that they hated knowledge, and did not chuſe the fear of the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24, 26, 32.</p>

                  <p>Here begins the third meſſage unto the third named Church: And her Chriſt deſcribes himſelf with the ſharp ſword with two edges<hi>:</hi> with this ſword he will fight againſt thoſe that are enemies to his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp; be an adverſary to their adverſaries who obey his voice, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 22. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 35. 1, 4. And with this alſo he will fight againſt his Churches, or amongſt them, if they provoke him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 20, 21. As it is ſaid: <hi>they rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and vexed his holy ſpirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought againſt them, Iſay</hi> 63. 10. So it is a ſharp ſword with two edges, to fight both ways. And as the Lord propounds that ſaying, <hi>[The Lord thy God is a conſuming fire,]</hi> Both to warn his people, that they might not ſin againſt him, leſt he deſtroyed them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 23, 24, 26. and to encourage them to keep his way, and not to fear their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, for in ſo doing he would deſtroy them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. 3. So here he may appear with this two-edged ſword.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, he gives no terrible deſcription of himſelf to any of the ſeven Churches, but to this and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> both which were polluted with falſe teachers: To ſhew how abominable, and provoking unto him it is, to ſuffer ſuch: [ſee the notes after on <hi>v.</hi> 18.]</p>

                  <p n="1">1. More generally; he worketh and ruleth in the hearts of all that are in darkneſs and diſobedience to the glorious Goſpel. <hi>The prince of the air is the ſpirit that worketh ruleingly,</hi> or effectually, <hi>in the Children of diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 2. 2, 3. he is <hi>the ruler of the darkneſs of this World, Eph.</hi> 6. 12.

But this is not the meaning of Satan's throne here: for this Angel &amp; Church did not dwell in the hearts of unbelievers, nor were loved and delighted in by them, no more than any other Church; but hated and perſecuted by ſuch as theſe.</p>

Now from this whole verſe, we may briefly take notice of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As before is intmated; that Chriſt may have and preſerve his Church, and doth ſo, in dangerous places and times: Thus here he did where Satan's throne and habitation was<hi>:</hi> So in myſtery <hi>Babilon</hi> his people will be, when her deſtruction comes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. So when <hi>Elias</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lord: they have killed thy Prophets, and digged down thine altars, and I am left alone, and they ſeek my life:</hi> what ſaith the Anſwer of God unto him? <hi>I have reſerved unto my ſelf ſeven thouſand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal, Rom.</hi> 11. 3, 4. with 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 10, 14, 18. <hi>Iſay</hi> 1. 10, 14. And this ſhews the care and faithfulneſs of Chriſt to them, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 22. 30, 31. And it may comfort us alſo in the worſt and moſt perilous times that may come.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Chriſt takes notice of the dangers his people are in, the dangerous places and times they live in<hi>:</hi> his eye is upon them for good therein: <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thy tribulation, &amp;c.</hi> [ſee the notes on <hi>v.</hi> 9.] <hi>I have ſeen, I have ſeen, ſaith the Lord, the affliction of my people which is in</hi> Aegypt, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 34. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 7, 9. he takes notice of all the circumſtances, and aggravations of their affliction, and tribulations, ſo as to preſerve them in the moſt perilous days and places; and in due ſeaſon to requite the injuries done unto them: as here he deſcribes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a ſharp ſword<hi>:</hi> And though their enemies ſay, <hi>God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, he hides his face, he will never ſee:</hi> yet as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>thou haſt ſeen, for thou beholdeſt miſchief and ſpite, to requite it with thine hand,</hi> Pſ. 10. 11, 15. Zech. 9. 8. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and his ears are open to their cry, &amp;c.</hi> Pſ. 34. 15, 19. <hi>Let not</hi> Zion <hi>then ſay, the Lord hath forſaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me: for though a Woman may forget the Son of her womb, yet he will not forget his</hi> Zion: <hi>he hath graven her on the palmes of his hands, her walls are continually before him, Iſay.</hi> 49. 14, 16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That it is a very great trial to his people, when they live, and dwell in ſuch places and times: they have then many temptations on the right hand, and on the left, to let go their faith, or the profeſſion thereof<hi>:</hi> and they are in heavineſs thorow manifold temptations, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6. Eſpecially when ſome amongſt them ſuffer, or any one of them is ſlain for the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 32, 33. many now are ready to ſtumble; yea too many oft-times do fall off: There is no ſuch great trial when God gives reſt to his Churches, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 31. But rather then, many will cleave to them with flatteries, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 34. But when their adverſaries amongſt whom they live, are permitted to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48916:140"/>
perſecute, and vex them, and kill ſome of them, here is the patience and faith of the Saints. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 7, 8, 10. and <hi>ch.</hi> 14. 12.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is highly approveable unto Chriſt, and commendable with him, that his Servants hold faſt his name, and do not deny his faith, in ſuch trying times and places: Oh it is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour, that when thus tried, we hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith and hope without wavering, whatever loſs, or ſufferings we may expoſe our ſelves unto thereby, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 23, 26. and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 13, 14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 8, 9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14, 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 3, 9. And then to let go the faith, or profeſſion thereof, is very provoking unto him, and dangerous to our ſelves: whoſoever is aſhamed of him, and of his words in an adulterous and ſinful generation; of him alſo will the Son of Man be aſhamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy Angels, <hi>Mark.</hi> 8. 38. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That his people may then hold faſt: God is their refuge and ſtrength, a very preſent help in trouble, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 46. 1. And hath not given to them the Spirit of fear, but of power, of love, and of a ſound mind; that they might not be aſhamed of the teſtimony of our Lord, but be partakers of the afflictions of the Goſpel according to the power of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9. <hi>Be we then ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, Eph.</hi> 6. 10, 18, And conſider them who thorow faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence inherit the Promiſes: Looking eſpecially unto Jeſus the author and finiſher of the faith, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 6. 10, 12. and <hi>ch.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The conſideration of Chriſt's having a ſharp ſword with two edges is proper and powerful to ſtrengthen us, to harden our hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fear of Man, and to engage us to fear him: <hi>He is the Lord of hoſts, mighty in battle: The Lord is a Man of war, the Lord is his name, &amp;c. Exod.</hi> 15. 1, 2. 3.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. To endeavour to change and alter God's word and mind plainly made known and declared to him<hi>:</hi> For God ſaid unto <hi>Balaam, thou ſhalt not go with the meſſengers of</hi> Balac, <hi>thou ſhalt not curſe the people,</hi> at which time he did not go, though his mind was too much inclined to the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; but he ſaid unto them, <hi>The Lord refuſeth to, give me leave to go go with you, Numb.</hi> 22. 5, 14. yet when <hi>Balac</hi> ſent again Princes, more, and more honourable then the former he was not content with what God had at the firſt ſpoken to him; but again gives entertainment unto his meſſengers, and entreateth them to tarry that night alſo that he might know what the Lord would ſay to him more, <hi>v.</hi> 15. 20. as if, though he had revealed his mind plainly enough before, yet, there might be ſome ſecret will in God coutrary to his revealed: Or he might move him to change his mind or word: well, <hi>God came unto Balaam, and ſaid unto him: If the Men come to call thee riſe up, and go with them: But yet the word that I ſhall ſay unto thee, that ſhalt thou do:</hi> But he, it ſeems, never ſtays for being called, but roſe up in the morning, and ſadled his aſs, and went with the princes of <hi>Moab, v.</hi> 15. 21.

                  <p n="3">3.

The way evil teachers walk in, to draw believers from Chriſt, is, to preach ſuch Doctrine, or give ſuch counſel as tends to gratify the fleſh; and many times to gratify it in this particular luſt of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: ſo it was with thoſe falſe teachers the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of, who were like to, if not the ſame with theſe <hi>Balaamites</hi> here mentioned. They were laſcivious perſons, and had eyes full of an adultereſs, and that cannot ceaſe from ſin, beguiling unſtable ſouls:—And they did allure thorow the luſts of the fleſh, thorow much wantonneſs thoſe that were clean eſcaped from them that live in errour: while they promiſed them liberty, they themſelves were the Servants of corruption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 14, 19. they turned the grace of our God into la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciviouſneſs, and did defile the fleſh, and entice others ſo to do alſo: and, as it here appears, taught thoſe that were in power and authority thus to debauch Chriſts diſciples; and to lay this ſtumbling-block be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, to tempt them to commit fornication, even outward and corporal alſo, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. 4, 8.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. And more particularly: In that he calls this Angel and Church to repentance, upon the account aforeſaid<hi>:</hi> ſo he ſignifieth to us, that it is an evil and therefore to be repented of, to have, or ſuffer evil, and corrupt teachers amongſt us: this plainly appears here in this place<hi>:</hi> as alſo, this is the charge drawn up againſt the Angel of the Church in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> by our Saviour, who ſaith unto them<hi>: I have a few things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, becauſe thou ſuffereſt that Woman</hi> Jezabel, <hi>which calleth her ſelf a Propheteſs; to teach, and to ſeduce my Servants, &amp;c.

And indeed, this is an evil thing, as is before ſhewed. It is dangerous unto our ſelves, we may be enſnared by them<hi>:</hi> or however in tolerating and countenancing them, we ſhall be partakers of their evil deeds, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 11. It is hurtful to the falſe teachers themſelves, and tends to ſtrengthen and confirm them in their evil doctrines, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 14. and it is harmful unto others: And as the Apoſtle ſaith in another caſe, ſo it may be ſaid in this<hi>: If any Man ſee thee which haſt knowledge, entertain, or encourage falſe teachers, ſhall not he be emboldned to follow thine example: and ſo may thy weak Brother periſh for whom Chriſt died.</hi> And it is ſtill a greater evil in Chriſt's Angels, to ſuffer falſe teachers: and therefore ſo frequently <hi>Paul</hi> gives ſuch warnings as theſe to <hi>Timothy: from ſuch with-draw thy ſelf,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6 3, 5. and <hi>ch.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 7. and <hi>ch.</hi> 6. 20. 21. <hi>ſhun prophane and vain bablings; for they will increaſe to more ungodlineſs: And their word will eat as doth a cancker, or gangrene, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 5. 13, 14.</p>

More generally; and as with relation to <hi>v.</hi> 15. where he ſaith, <hi>[I hate the Doctrine.]</hi> and here, <hi>[I will fight againſt them:]</hi> That if Men hold hateful doctrines, or do hateful deeds, it will at laſt provoke Chriſt to fight againſt their perſons; and their iniquity, if continued in, will be their ruine, the everlaſting ruine both of Soul and Body, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 30. and <hi>ch.</hi> 24, 1, 4. Mens teaching, receiving, and retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the accurſed thing, will make them accurſed alſo<hi>:</hi> hence God ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bring an abomination into thine houſe, left thou be a curſed thing like it: But thou ſhalt uttterly deteſt it, and thou ſhalt utterly abhor it, for it is a curſed thing,</hi> Deut. 7. 26. and again; <hi>you in any wiſe keep your ſelves from the accurſed thing, lest ye make your ſelves accurſed when ye take of the accurſed thing,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p n="2">2. And more particularly; it will provoke Chriſt to anger, and teſtimonies of diſpleaſure, to hold evil doctrines; ſuch as tend to the enſnareing and polluting God's people: as God fought againſt <hi>Balaam,</hi> ſo will he alſo fight againſt his followers, and ſuch as are like unto him: <hi>his ways are everlasting, Numb.</hi> 31. 8. thoſe falſe teachers, who pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily bring in hereſies of ſwift deſtruction, <hi>and their judgment now of a long time lingreth not, and their damnation ſlumbreth not,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1, 3, 13, 15. <hi>Thoſe filthy dreamers go in the way of</hi> Cain, <hi>and run greedily after the errour of</hi> Balaam <hi>for a reward, and will periſh in the gainſaying of Core.</hi> Jude 21. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord: Becauſe ye have ſpoken vanity, and ſeen lies, therefore behold I am againſt you, ſaith the Lord God.

3. He ſaith, <hi>[I will fight against them with the ſword of my mouth.]</hi> And ſo he will write their ſin upon their puniſhment: they tranſgreſſed with their mouths or words, and he will fight againſt them with his word in his Goſpel and judgments, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Iſay</hi> 55. 11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 15. and <hi>he is ſtrong that executeth his word,</hi> ſo that his word, and not theirs, ſhall ſtand, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 28.</p>
                  <p>But here we might propound to conſideration theſe two following queſtions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. It might be queried, whether in caſe this Angel and Church did repent, Chriſt would not fight againſt thoſe falſe teachers with the Sword of his mouth quickly?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this we may give anſwer, and ſay no: it doth plainly appear, that if this Angel and Church did receive Chriſt's counſel, and repent, he would not quickly fight againſt thoſe falſe teachers with the Sword of his Mouth: for, as hath been ſaid, the threat or commination is condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, both as with reſpect to this Angel and Church; and as with reſpect to thoſe that held evil doctrines amongſt them: it is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>repent or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them,</hi> &amp;c. By which it plainly appears, that upon their repentance, he would defer fighting againſt the <hi>Balaamites,</hi> and <hi>Nicolaitans:</hi> not as if their repentance would make the evil doctrines or teachers leſs evil, and hateful in themſelves, or unto Chriſt: But he would delay the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his judgments on theſe falſe teachers if his people repented, otherwiſe not.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe if this Angel and Church repented, they would not have ſuch evil teachers amongſt them, but would caſt them out and ſhew diſlike of, and diſpleaſure againſt them: For repentance includeth and containeth in it, not only a Godly ſorrow for, and confeſſion of ones evil, but a turning there-from<hi>:</hi> hence we have ſuch expreſſions, <hi>Repent and turn from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, Ezek.</hi> 14. 6. <hi>Repent and turn from all your tranſgreſſions: caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from you all your tranſgreſſions, whereby ye have tranſgreſſed, Ezek.</hi> 18. 30, 32. <hi>Jona</hi> 3. 8, 10. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 41. It is a putting away the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of ones doings from before God's eyes, and ceaſing to do evil, <hi>Iſay</hi> 1. 6. Now if this Angel and Church thus repented, and turn out theſe falſe teachers, then,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They would anſwer the end of Chriſt as to themſelves, namely, by this means they would free themſelves from the ſeducements of theſe evil teachers, and how pleaſing would this be to Chriſt who loves his Churches with peculiar manner of love, and is not willing that any of his little ones ſhould periſh.</p>

                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:48916:149"/>
2. And by their turning out, and ſo puniſhing, and publickly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their diſlike of evil teachers; it would cauſe Chriſt not to puniſh more immediatly: when his Servants faithfully puniſh what is evil he will not quickly take the Sword into his own hand, otherwiſe he will<hi>:</hi> had <hi>Eli</hi> curbed and puniſhed his Sons, God had not uſed that means which he afterwards more immediatly made uſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f: <hi>I have told</hi> Eli, <hi>ſaith the Lord, that I will judge his houſe for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth. Becauſe his Sons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30, 34. with <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 11, 13. And ſo here; If this Angel and Church did eject, and caſt out theſe falſe teachers, Chriſt would ſay, as he doth by the Apoſtle, concerning the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſtuous <hi>Corinthian: ſufficient unto them is this cenſure, or puniſhment; which was inflicted by many,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 3, 9. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 4, 26.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If they repented and turned out theſe evil teachers from amongſt them, this would be a good and effectual means of awakening theſe evil ones, and engaging them to conſider their principles, doctrines, and ways, and turn from them: And then Chriſt would alſo ſecond his Angel and Church, in giving theſe corrupt teachers further ſpace of repentance, as <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22. for <hi>he is not willing that any</hi> (no not ſeducers) <hi>ſhould periſh, while it is called to day, but that all ſhould come to repentance,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 9. this is the way to cauſe ſuch evil workers to bethink themſelves, and relinquiſh their evil doctrines, and therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle delivered <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> unto Satan, and caſt them out, that they might learn not to blaſpheme, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19, 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4, 5. And on the other hand, if they ſuffered them, or ſtill had them amongſt them, it would tend to ſtrengthen them in their pernicious doctrines and ways<hi>:</hi> and ſo Chriſt would more immediately be engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt thoſe evil teachers, that they might repent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt cannot endure that his name ſhould be polluted amongſt the heathen, but will aſſert and vindicate the honour thereof<hi>:</hi> hence the Lord ſaith many times, <hi>I wrote for my name ſake, that it ſhould not be pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted before the heathen, Ezek.</hi> 20. 9, 14, 22. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 79. 9. and 115. 1. now if this Angel and Church did not repent and caſt out thoſe evil and corrupt teachers; the heathen idolaters would reproach and blaſpheme the worthy name of Chriſt, and ſay, it was a doctrine of looſeneſs, and licentiouſneſs, and taught Men to commit idolatry, and to act all manner of uncleanneſs and filthineſs whatever: Therefore for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his name he would come quickly, and fight againſt theſe evil ones, if this Angel and Church repented not: otherwiſe in their repenting
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48916:149"/>
this occaſion would be removed. Yea and if they repented not, he would fight againſt theſe <hi>Balaamites,</hi> and <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> and ſo vindicate the honour of his name, for the good and conviction of the profeſſed heathen, amongſt whom they were; that they might know, he is one that loveth righteouſneſs, and hateth iniquity: that ſo they might ſeek and worſhip him with his people; whereas if his people did reject and caſt off theſe evil workers, and ſo had their converſation honeſt amongſt the Gentiles; this would cauſe them to glorify God in the day of their viſitation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11, 12. And Chriſt would not, upon that account, quickly fight againſt theſe falſe teachers with the Sword of his mouth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If this Angel and Church did not, as here they are counſelled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, repent, his fighting againſt thoſe falſe teachers would be a powerful means to awaken them to repent; and to occaſion and provoke them to waſh their feet in the blood of the wicked, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 58. 9, 10. ſo when he was puniſhing the enemies of his people, he ſaid: <hi>ſurely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive inſtruction, &amp;c.

As he ſaith in his Epiſtle to <hi>Thyatira, I will caſt her,</hi> Jezabel <hi>the falſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on except they repent of their deeds; and I will kill her Children with death: and all the Churches ſhall know that I am he which ſearcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works, Rev.</hi> 2. 22, 23. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 94. 10.</p>
                  <p>By all which we may, in ſome Meaſure, ſee, that they are moſt uncharitable to evil and corrupt teachers, as well as to their own Souls, who have and countenance them<hi>:</hi> For by ſo doing, they provoke Chriſt more immediately to fight againſt them.</p>

It might be further queried; whether Chriſt's fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe falſe teachers, would be alſo a teſtimony of diſpleaſure unto this Angel and Church? for ſo it appears to be in that he ſaith and threatneth; <hi>[I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight againſt them, &amp;c.]</hi>

                  <p>And to that we may ſay<hi>:</hi> our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſheweth unto us what is meant thereby, to wit, himſelf: In that when the <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naites</hi> ſay unto him, <hi>Our Fathers did eat manna in the deſert,</hi> as it is written, <hi>He gave them bread from heaven to eat. Then Jeſus ſaith unto them:</hi> verily, verily, <hi>I ſay unto you;</hi> Moſes <hi>gave you not that bread from Heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread from Heaven: For the bread of God is he that cometh down from Heaven, and giveth life unto the World: And again Jeſus ſaith unto them, I am the bread of life, &amp;c. Joh.</hi> 6. 30, 35. the Lord himſelf is the true bread, <hi>Iſay</hi> 55. 2, 3, 6. And himſelf, as he hath partaken of our nature and been delivered for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtification: the bread that he will give, the true manna, is his fleſh which he hath given for the life of the World: <hi>his fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed, Joh.</hi> 6. 48. 51, 58, 63. he is indeed the meat which God hath prepared for us to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe as Manna was provided for, and promiſed to them, when they were very evil, and behaved themſelves unworthy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16, 2, 4. So Jeſus Chriſt was fore-ordained and given when we were ſinful and pollutted ones, and had by our ſin deſerved to have periſhed for ever, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>while we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly; God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us,</hi> Rom. 5 6, 8. <hi>Chriſt once ſuffered for ſins, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the fleſh, but quickened by the ſpirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Manna was given without any labour, or work of theirs, without
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48916:150"/>
any plowing, or ſowing of theirs; as is ſignified to us in what the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Moſes; Behold I will rain bread from heaven for you; It came down as the rain or ſhowers upon the graſs, that tarrieth not for Man, nor waiteth for the Sons of Men, Exod.</hi> 16. 4. with <hi>Mica.</hi> 5. 7. So alſo it is true of this heavenly and ſpiritual bread, even Jeſus Chriſt. It was not of mens providing, or preparing; but God prepared himſelf this lamb for a burnt-offering, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 8, 14. he found out this ranſom, <hi>Job.</hi> 33. 24. <hi>while we were yet without ſtrength, and ungodly ones, Chriſt died for us, Rom.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>my Father,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>giveth you the true bread from Heaven: All things are of God, Joh.</hi> 6. 32. and <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 14, 16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Job</hi> 28. 12, 20, 27.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Manna was ground in a mill, or beaten in a morter, and baked, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 18. ſo Jeſus Chriſt was broken for us, that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come good food for us to feed on, that he might be bread of life for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24. he was tormented for our tranſgreſſions, bruiſed (like bread-corn, <hi>Iſay</hi> 28. 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) for our iniquities; <hi>the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him:</hi> It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief, <hi>Iſay</hi> 53. 4, 6, 10. This corn of wheat fell into the ground and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<hi>:</hi> God brought him into the duſt of death; and he gave his fleſh for the life of the world; and ſo is become living, quickning bread for us to feed on, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 51. with <hi>ch.</hi> 12. 23. <hi>he was made the curſe of God for us, that he might redeem us from the curſe of the law, Joh.</hi> 12. 27, 31. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Manna was a ſweet and pleaſant food to eat, delightful to the taſte: <hi>the taſte of it was like wafers made with honey, Exod</hi> 16. 31. So is Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt become thorow his perſonal abaſement and ſufferings, in the vertue whereof he is raiſed again; he is infinitely ſweeter than ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and the honey-comb. As the Lord ſignifies when he in viteth every thirſter to come unto him; <hi>hearken diligently unto me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and eat ye that which is good and let your ſoul delight it ſelf in fatneſs, Iſay</hi> 55. 1, 3, 5. <hi>I ſate down, ſaith the ſpouſe, under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſte,</hi> Cant. 2. 3. <hi>Oh taſte and ſee that the Lord is gracious.</hi> He is ſo in himſelf, whether men taſte and perceive it, or no; but they prove him ſo to be, whoſo hear and learn of the Father, as to come unto, and eat him, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 34. 8. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3, 4. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 56, 57.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Manna came down with the dew of heaven, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 13, 14. <hi>when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it, Numb.</hi> 11. 9. ſo Chriſt in and by his Goſpel and ſpirit cometh down, and ſo cometh down, that a Man, any man, may eat thereof, and

not dye, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 2, 3. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 33, 50, 63. and hence our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaid unto his diſciples, when he ſent them forth to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: <hi>he that heareth you, heareth me. And he that receiveth you, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, &amp;c. Luke</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 40. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 21, 23. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Manna was too much ſleighted, undervalued, and loathed by them, in proceſs of time; though at the firſt they admired thereat, and ſaid, <hi>what is this, Exod.</hi> 16. 15. yet afterward they murmured thereat, and were diſcontented, and ſaid: <hi>Our Soul is dried away: there is nothing at all be ſides this manna before our eyes,</hi> Numb. 11. 6. and <hi>ch.</hi> 21. 5, And <hi>therefore the Lord was angry with them, and ſent fiery ſerpents amongſt them, Numb.</hi> 21. 6. So Jeſus Chriſt, though he be a wonderful gift of Gods grace and an everlaſting witneſs and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God's love to us, is yet rejected and deſpiſed of Men, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 53. 2, 4. he is disallowed indeed of Men, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. and of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders alſo, <hi>v.</hi> 7. and too much and too often by ſuch as have formerly taſted his graciouſneſs, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5. and <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 3. whereby God is greatly provoked to anger: And <hi>how ſhall they eſcape who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect ſo great ſalvation?

                  <p n="2">2. We come next to ſhew, why Chriſt is here called <hi>[hidden manna]</hi> and that is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe he is the myſtery of that former Manna, the ſecret there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<hi>:</hi> that was a type, or figure of Jeſus Chriſt, as he is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the Tabernacle, and temple; ſo it is here, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 27. 4, 5. and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Chriſt, was the ſecret or hidden thing typed forth by the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the law generally: <hi>they had a ſhadow of good things to come, but the body is of Chriſt, Col.</hi> 2. 16, 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. ſo here particularly<hi>: the former manna typified, or ſhadowed forth Jeſus Chriſt as the bread of life, Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> 6. 32, 35. and ſo Chriſt may be called the hidden Manna, with reference to that manna in the Pot, that was kept in the holieſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 33, 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 4. which was a type of Chriſt, who died for all, yea rather is riſen again, and who is gone up into Heaven it ſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 30. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 51. with <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hidden manna Chriſt may be called poſſibly, to deno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of this manna: as thoſe things which are moſt rich and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent are called hidden things: ſo we read of treaſures hid in the ſand, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 19. and hid treaſures, <hi>Job</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 4. ſo hidden wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

is the moſt excellent wiſdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. and the hidden Man the moſt excellent, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. So Jeſus Chriſt is the Manna, infinitely more excellent than the former Manna was; As will appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That was called Angels food, as it is written<hi>: Man did eat An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels food, Pſ.</hi> 78. 25. But Chriſt is ſaid to be, and is the bread of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 33.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That was typical bread; But Chriſt is the truth thereof<hi>: My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>giveth you the true bread from Heaven, Joh.</hi> 6. 32. and as far as the truth exceedeth the type, and the ſubſtance the ſhadow; ſo far doth Chriſt excel and go beyond that manna.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That was dead bread; If it were kept long it would putrify and corrupt: as it is ſaid, <hi>ſome of them kept of it until the morning, and it bred worms and ſtank, Exod</hi> 16. 20. But Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and to day, and for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 8. his blood is incorruptible blood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. And he is raiſed again now no more to return to corruption, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 32, 34. And is and abides for ever the true God and eternal life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. and that manna was dead bread alſo in this reſpect; it would not give life unto, or quicken ſuch as were dead. But Chriſt is the bread of life<hi>:</hi> for he cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world, the dead World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 33, 35. <hi>He cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the dead to hear his voice, and they that hear ſhall live, Joh.</hi> 5. 24, 25. <hi>he is the life, Joh.</hi> 14. 6.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though that came down from heaven, yet, it ſeems, not from the higheſt Heaven, but from the clouds; as it is ſaid: <hi>He commanded the clouds from above—and rained manna, Pſ.</hi> 78. 24, 25. and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith: <hi>Moſes gave you not that bread from Heaven, Joh.</hi> 6. 32.

                  <p n="5">5. That would not preſerve the eater from death, but as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith, <hi>your Fathers did eat manna in the wilderneſs, and are dead, Joh.</hi> 6. 49, 58. But Chriſt is the living bread that came down from Heaven: <hi>If any Man eat of this Bread he ſhall live for ever: whoſo eateth his fleſh and drinketh his blood hath eternal life, and he wil raiſe him up at the laſt day: he that eateth of this bread ſhall live, Joh.</hi> 6. 50, 51, 53. 58,</p>

So alſo he appears terribly to the Angel and Church in <hi>Pergamos,</hi> who were guilty of the like evil as theſe were. [See the Notes before on <hi>v.</hi> 12, 15.] And though there were great evils in other of theſe Churches, as in <hi>Epheſus, Sardis,</hi> and <hi>Laodicea:</hi> Yet he only appears terrible in the deſcription of himſelf to theſe two Churches who had evil and corrupt teachers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 11.</p>

                  <p>And in that this is added after that terrible deſcription he had given of himſelf, ſo he gives us to underſtand; That though his Eyes are like a flame of fire, and his feet like fine braſs, yet he approves and encourages whatſoever is good and approvable in his Churches: they might ſay, <hi>Alas if he thus appear, who can ſtand?</hi> Or what can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved before him? who can ſtand before this holy Lord God, that is of ſuch a piercing inſpection, and ſo terrible in his Eyes and Feet? Truly, the Sinners in <hi>Zion</hi> may be afraid, and the Hypocrites ſurprized with fear. But ſuch as receive his Grace, or wherein ſoever they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to purpoſe, need not be afraid: his appearing ſo dreadful is not to diſcourage, or hinder them from doing good; but to deter them from what is evil, <hi>Iſay</hi> 33. 14, 16.

                  <p>1. We have the charge more generally drawn up againſt this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel and Church: <hi>[Becauſe thou ſuffereſt that Woman</hi> Jezabel.]</p>

The evil of this Angel and Church was not, that <hi>Jezabel</hi> taught falſe doctrine ſimply: But that they did not forbid, or hinder her; that they did not rebuke her ſharply, and ſo ſtop, or muzzel her mouth and not ſuffer her to vent her erroneous and deſtructive doctrines amongſt them: <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 10, 13. So God is ſaid, not to ſuffer what he ſtraitly forbids<hi>:</hi> As, the Lord thy God hath not ſuffered thee to hearken unto obſervers of times, and unto diviners, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 14. that is, he hath ſtrictly forbidden thee ſo to do<hi>:</hi> And yet they might poſſibly be guilty of ſuch an iniquity; though their God ſuffered them not ſo to do, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 35. Now this was the evil found with this Angel and Church, not that they commanded, or encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſo to do, or that ſhe taught evil doctrines ſimply: But they did not forbid, or make it their work to hinder her, by their convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſharpe rebukes, and prohibitions of her, but did even tolerate her ſo to do.</p>

                  <p>1. That this <hi>Jezabel</hi> here ſpoken of was ſome idolatrous, and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian congregation, that was amongſt the Church in <hi>Thyatira;</hi> and that worſhipped ſome falſe object of worſhip, or the true God after a falſe manner; as afterwards alſo appeareth by the account given of her doctrine: and ſo this framed congregation was like to <hi>Jezabel</hi> of old, who was one that worſhipped <hi>Baal,</hi> and had Prophets of the groves that eat at her table, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16. 31, 33. and <hi>ch.</hi> 18. 19. And

like to her was this woman herein: And like unto, if not in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame with, myſtery <hi>Babilon;</hi> which hath in her right hand a golden cup full of abominations and filthineſs of her fornication, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 1, 2, 5. for in the Apoſtles days, that myſtery of iniquity did begin to work, though it was not ſo revealed as it hath been ſince, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 3, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>2. This whoriſh ſociety is called and compared to <hi>Jezabel</hi> of old, to give us to underſtand that they were enemies unto, and full of cruelty againſt the true Prophets and Servants of the Lord, as was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab's</hi> wife 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 4, 13. and <hi>ch.</hi> 19. 1, 2. and <hi>ch.</hi> 21. 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is alſo true of myſtery <hi>Babilon,</hi> the great whore: <hi>they have ſhed the blood of Saints and Prophets,</hi> Rev. 16. 6. <hi>that woman was drunken with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Rev.</hi> 17. 6. and <hi>ch.</hi> 18. 24. and <hi>ch.</hi> 19. 2. how many thouſands, and ten thouſands hath this Mother of harlots, and her confederates murthered and ſhed the blood of? yea they hold it to be a meritorious work to kill and deſtroy Hereticks; and ſuch they account all them to be who will not hold communion with them, or commit whoredom, and ſpiritual fornication with them.</p>
                  <p>3. This woman is likened to <hi>Jezabel,</hi> in former times, to ſignify the witch-crafts they make uſe of, both more ſpiritually and more groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9 22. more ſpiritually, all falſe and antichriſtian teachers are witches, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. and thoſe Antichriſtian Chriſtians uſe it alſo more grosſly, many of them<hi>:</hi> The coming of the Man of ſin is after the working of Satan, with all power, and ſigns, and lying wonders, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 8, 10. And by the forcerers (both ſpiritual and carnal) of myſtery <hi>Babilon</hi> were all nations deceived, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 23.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>Jezabel</hi> of old is this Antichriſtian ſociety likened here, becauſe ſhe gave forth her ſelf to be a Queen: ſuch an one was <hi>Ahabs</hi> wife indeed, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16. 31. ſo myſtery <hi>Babilon</hi> is too generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as, and gives forth her ſelf to be a queen: ſhe ruleth over the Kings of the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 18. and by her ſitting upon the Scarlet-coloured Beaſt, and ruling, ſhe lives d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>5. This framed idolatrous congregation is alſo called <hi>Jezabel,</hi> becauſe as <hi>Jezabel</hi> of old did paint her face, and tire her head, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 30. ſo did theſe evil and falſe worſhippers<hi>:</hi> and ſo Idolatrous ones gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, to gain love from others, and to draw them in to commit fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by their appearing beauty and amiableneſs<hi>:</hi> they cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

with crimſon, and deck themſelves with ornaments of Gold, and even rent their faces with painting, that they make themſelves fair, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 30. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 40, 44. And how doth myſtery <hi>Babilon</hi> paint her face, and deck her ſelf with the, riches and bravery of this World! and how doth ſhe cry up her ſelf to be the only true catholick Church! and how boaſts ſhe of her unity, ſucceſſion, number, antiquity, infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <p>6. And laſtly: This whoriſh Church is here compared to <hi>Jezabel</hi> of old, and called <hi>Jezabel,</hi> to ſignify the miſerable end and concluſion thereof, ſo abiding and continuing, as afterwards followeth, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 32. 35. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 21, 23. and ſad and miſerable will be the concluſion of myſtery <hi>Babilon: her plagues ſhall come in one hour, death, and mour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now in that this is the Charge he draws up againſt this Angel, <hi>Becauſe thou ſufferedſt that Woman</hi> Jezabel,] So we may note from hence,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is an evil thing in Chriſt's Angels and Churches, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer falſe teachers to teach amongſt them; and their doing ſo is very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to him, and dangerous to themſelves, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1, 3, 19, 20. [See the notes on <hi>ver.</hi> 14.] Yea though his Angels and Churches have not been corrupted, or polluted by their Inſtructions which cauſe to err from the words of knowledge; yet he is angry with his people for ſuffering ſuch amongſt them, as we have ſeen before in <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. Nay though this is the laſt Branch of the commendation of this Angel and Church, [that their laſt works were more than their firſt.] Yet he immediately ſubjoyns thereto, <hi>[not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I have a few things againſt thee, becauſe thou ſuffereſt that Woman</hi> Jezabel <hi>to teach, &amp;c.]</hi> Some may ſay; though we do give entertainment unto and ſuffer falſe teachers amongſt us, yet we ſtill hold faſt the forme of ſound words and abound in good works<hi>:</hi> Well, though all this be true, yet the ſame Chriſt ſaith of this Angel and Church; he ſaith it, who perfectly knows all things: Nevertheleſs all this, he was angry with them, and draws up this charge againſt them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that Chriſt had before commended this Angel and Church for their Charity and Service or Adminiſtration, and now blames and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves them for ſuffering this falſe Propheteſs among them; ſo he plainly ſignifies to us, and gives us to underſtand, that it is no Charity, nor ſervice of love, to ſuffer falſe Teachers: Nay, it is oppoſite to love and the ſervice thereof ſo to do; It is hatred to them, to
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:48916:161"/>
ſuffer Sin upon them, and to ſtrengthen them in their lies and errors, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 17. And it's hatred to our ſelves, though we be not enſnared by them, for thereby we are partakers of their evil deeds, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 11. And it's hatred unto others, becauſe by occaſion of our ſuffering them, they may entertain their evil Doctrines, and either be hindred from receiving the Goſpel, or be removed therefrom, after they have given entertainment to it. It is a fruit of Charity to forbid, and hinder falſe teachers what we can lawfully<hi>:</hi> ſo much the Apoſtle ſignifieth to us when he ſaith to <hi>Timothy; I beſought thee to abide ſtill in</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>that thou mighteſt, charge ſome, that they teach no other Doctrine;</hi> to wit, <hi>beſide the Doctrine of Chriſt:</hi> To which he adds by and by: Now <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But it is an old trick of the Devil's, to call evil good, and good evil, that the evil may be embraced, and the good rejected and abhorred by us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt gives a more particular account of <hi>Jezabel</hi>'s Evil, and therein intimately of his Angels and Churches evil in permitting and ſuffering her. And this is propounded to us,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By what ſhe ſaid of her ſelf, [which calleth her ſelf a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs.]</p>
                  <p>This was the evil of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and is ſo of other falſe Teachers, to profeſs themſelves to be what they are not, even true Teachers or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt.

                     <hi>She calleth her ſelf a Propheteſs]</hi> either ſo in an extraordinary ſenſe; and ſo propheſying ſignifieth predicting, or fore-telling future things: Thus in former times, many falſe Prophets pretended to Prophecy, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 10, 12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 31. and <hi>ch.</hi> 14. 13, 14. and <hi>ch.</hi> 27. 9. And thus our Saviour tells his Diſciples, that there would ariſe falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and they would ſhew great ſigns and wonders, <hi>&amp;c. Mat:</hi> 24. 11, 24.</p>
                  <p>Or rather, more ordinarily ſhe called her ſelf a Propheteſs; that is, a Teacher of others, and ſuch an one as pretended to ſpeak unto E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, and Exhortation and Comfort.

                  <p n="2">2. In that he ſaith <hi>[none other burden]</hi> ſo he gives us to underſtand; that he did not put that as a burden upon them, that they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the ſeducers depths of Satan, as they ſpeak; <hi>for that might be hurtful to them.</hi> In former times God charged his people, to take heed unto themſelves that they were not ſnared by following after Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.—And that they ſhould not enquire after their Gods, ſaying, <hi>How did theſe Nations ſerve their God?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 30, 32. And we are commanded, to go from the preſence of a fooliſh man, when once we perceive not in him the lip of knowledge, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 7. and <hi>ch.</hi> 19. 27: Many do much miſtake and abuſe that ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>[Try all things,]</hi> as if hereby liberty were given to them to hear all falſe teachers whatever; whereby many become a prey unto Foxes, and embrace and follow pernicious ways: whereas the Apoſtle gives that exhortation, not unto all, but only to ſuch as had received the Apoſtles word, not as the word of men, but as it is in truth the word of God, which alſo wrought effectually in them, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 3, 6. and <hi>ch.</hi> 2. 13. And again, that exhortation of the Apoſtles gives none, ſuch undue liberty, as too many take; but it is to be conſidered by us as relating unto what goes before; <hi>viz. deſpiſe not propheſying,</hi> (to wit,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:48916:173"/>
ſuch ſpeakings of the word of Chriſt as are to edification, and exhortation, and comfort, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 14. 1, 3.) And then adds, <hi>[try,</hi> or, prove <hi>all things, &amp;c.]</hi> Namely, in thoſe propheſyings we ſhould not deſpiſe we are not to take all on truſt which they ſay; but to ſearch the Scriptures, whether the things delivered therein be ſo or no; and hold faſt what is good, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 19, 21. with <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11, 12. But this gives us no liberty to ſearch into the depths of Satan, or to be heaping to our ſelves teachers after our own luſts, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3, 4. It is a commendation of thoſe upright ones in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> both Teachers, and thoſe that were taught, in this Verſe 24. <hi>They have not known the depths of Satan,</hi> as they ſpeak: And our Lord lays no ſuch burden upon them, as to ſeek after the knowledge thereof<hi>:</hi> this is the Character Chriſt gives of his Sheep; <hi>A Stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him, for they know not the Voice of Strangers; all that ever came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me are Thieves and Robbers, but the Sheep did not hear them,</hi> Joh. 10. 4, 5, 8, 27. Chriſt lays upon his ſincere followers no other burden but to hold faſt what they have. He would not have them receive, or liſten unto any new Doctrine; for the word of his grace is able to build them up, and to give them an Inheritance among them that are ſanctified, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 32. And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the anointing you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him,</hi> (to wit, the things they had heard from the beginning,) <hi>abideth in you; and ye need not that any Man teach you; but as the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Joh. 2. 20, 24, 27. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>though we, or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other Goſpel unto you; than that which we have preached unto you, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed. As we ſaid before, ſo ſay I now again: If any Man preach any other Goſpel to you then that ye have received, let him be accurſed,</hi> Gal. 1. 6, 8, 9, 10.</p>

                  <p>In this Verſe Chriſt gives gracious and uſeful counſel to this Angel and Church; and lays down a Reaſon or Argument to ingage them to receive it.</p>
                  <p>We may from the former part of the Verſe note in general,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that our Lord Jeſus gives ſuch good and uſeful Counſel and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction unto dead ones, and ſuch dead ones alſo; that Chriſt is not willing that ſuch as theſe, who after they have been enlivened and quickened in their Spirits, have again brought themſelves into a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition, ſo as they are even become dead; ſhould periſh and be loſt for ever, while it is called to day; though their iniquity be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great and highly provoking to him, yet he hath no pleaſure, none at all in the death of him that dieth: he hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, of ſuch wicked ones alſo as have left off to be wiſe, and to do good, but that ſuch turn and live; as he hath both ſaid and ſworn, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 23, 31, 32. and <hi>ch.</hi> 33. 11. with <hi>Pſ.</hi> 36. 1, 3, 4, 7. <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 24. He is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9, 15. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. He would have all men to be ſaved, while the day of his grace and patience laſteth<hi>:</hi> And hence, when by his Apoſtle <hi>Jude,</hi> he warns of ſome ſuch ungodly ones, as turned the grace of our God into laſciviouſneſs; and is ſaying of them, <hi>they were trees without fruit, whoſe fruit withereth; twice dead, plucked up by the roots:</hi> yet he gives this inſtruction to the believers, And of ſome have compaſſion, making a difference: and others ſave with fear, pulling them out of the Fire, <hi>&amp;c. Jude</hi> 4. 12, 22, 23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that he gives this good and profitable counſel to thoſe who were dead in a Spiritual Conſideration, as we have ſeen; ſo he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to us, that his words are Spirit and Life unto ſuch as theſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 63. His Goſpel, with the Counſels, Commandments, and Inſtructions thereof, is the word of life, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 16. In and with this word he gives
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48916:185"/>
life preventingly to dead Souls, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 21, 25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 47. and is quickening them alſo, who thorow their carnal mindedneſs have again brought death upon themſelves, and loſt thoſe things which have been wrought in them by the Goſpel, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14. His word is with power, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 32. and while he calls he ſtretches forth his hand to enable men to turn at his reproofs, and to receive and obey his Counſel, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24. He doth lighten their Eyes, that they may not ſle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> the ſleep of death, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 13. 3. with <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 13. He works powerfully in and with his word, to the recalling, converting, and turning ſuch to himſelf as have ſold themſelves for their iniquities, and for their tranſgreſſions are put away<hi>:</hi> and hence he thus ſpeaketh to, and expoſtulateth with ſuch, <hi>wherefore when I came was there no Man? when I called was there none to anſwer? Is mine hand ſhortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? Iſay</hi> 50. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From hence then we may note, that when we ſay, dead Men may receive God's Word, Inſtruction and Counſel, while it is to day<hi>:</hi> we ſuppoſe not, nor believe that Men have naturally free-will, or power to turn, or quicken themſelves: for to be ſure, dead Men have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will nor power to any thing that is ſpiritually good: but in ſuch like ſayings we conclude, as we have good ground to do, that God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erts, and puts forth his power in and with his word, to enable them to what he requires of them: where the word of this great King is, without doubt there is power, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 4. hence he ſaith to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in former times: O thou that art named the houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> is the Spirit of the Lord ſhortened? though thou haſt neither will nor power to turn thy ſelf, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18, 19. yet is not his Spirit the Spirit of power and might, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Iſay,</hi> 11. 2. and is this ſpirit of his ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned towards thee to enable and ſtrengthen thee? Surely no, <hi>Mica.</hi> 2. 1. 7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may lead us highly to eſteem the word of Chriſt, to glorify the word of the Lord, and not liſten to or be deceived by them who call it the letter, and a dead letter, but to know, it is the miniſtration of the Spirit, and the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 17. The word of God is living and powerful, or in-working, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. It is able to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en dead ſouls, as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> confeſſes, ſaying, thy word hath quickened me: And again; with thy precepts thou haſt quickned me, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 50, 93. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1, 4. 5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It may inſtruct them that have this word of the Lord, and have it fitted in their lips, to ſpeak it Faithfully, and not to make uſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of ſpeech, or of wiſdom; But to know the word of God is
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:48916:185"/>
powerful, and needs not the additions, or mixtures of Man's eloquence or wiſdom, or the ſtrength of their arguments, or moſt powerful and perſwaſive demonſtrations and reaſons: the plain preaching of the croſs without wiſdom of words, is the power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17, 25. and <hi>ch.</hi> 2. 1, 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3, 8. <hi>If they had ſtood in my counſel,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and had cauſed my people to hear my words, then they ſhould have turned them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings.—he that hath my word let him ſpeak my word faithfully: what is the chaff to the wheat?</hi> ſaith the Lord. <hi>Is not my word like as a fire,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and like an hammer, that breaks the rock in pieces? Jer.</hi> 23. 22, 30. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It may provoke them that have it in their hearts, to take faſt hold of it, and not let it go, to keep it, for it is their life, life to their Soul, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 13. with <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 21, 22. If it will quicken dead Souls, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out peradventure it will keep and preſerve living ones in life: and they that hear it in hearing ſhall live; they ſhall never ſee death, <hi>Joh</hi> 5. 25, with <hi>ch.</hi> 8. 51. It is able to build them up, and to give them an inheritance among all them that are ſanctified, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 32. hence <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith: <hi>I will never forget thy precepts, for with them thou haſt quickned me, Pſ.</hi> 119. 93. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 24, 25. 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>But we come to look into, and ſpeak unto the words more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.</p>
                  <p>In which we ſhall look upon and conſider,</p>

Prov.</hi> 6. 9. ſo watching is oppoſed to ſleep<hi>:</hi> As, let us not ſleep as do others, but let us watch, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 6. Thus our Saviour, when he comes to the Diſciples, and finds them all aſleep, ſaith. <hi>Watch, &amp;c.</hi> namely, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake from your drowſineſs and ſleepineſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 40, 41. It is high time to awake out of ſleep, when perſons have brought themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a miſerable condition as this Angel and Church had done<hi>:</hi> like to that; <hi>awake to righteouſneſs and ſin not, for ſome have not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God: I ſpeak this to your ſhame,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 134.</p>
                  <p>Now then, from hence we may note for our Inſtruction and uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That theſe, who were in a wretched miſerable condition, were

yet aſleep and ſecure, and dreamed that their condition was good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough<hi>:</hi> they thought themſelves to be free from danger, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Chriſt's favour and well-pleaſedneſs<hi>:</hi> they might even lye a-bed and ſleep, they thought, for they had a name among the Churches that they lived, though indeed and in truth they were dead; thus alſo it was with <hi>Laodicea, v.</hi> 17. This Angel and Church were like to <hi>Jonah</hi> in former times; when the ſhip was like to be broken, and all in it ready to periſh, he was gone down into the ſides of the ſhip, and he lay, and was faſt aſleep: thus it was with theſe, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1. 4, 6. they were like to them that lye down in the midſt of the Sea, or as he that lieth aſleep upon the top of a maſt; in the very mouth of danger and deſtruction, and yet inſenſible of it, unacquainted with it, or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo to be: Oh dreadful caſe<hi>!</hi> Oh deplorable condition! <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 34, 35. they might think their mountain was ſo ſtrong ſetled, that they ſhould never be moved, they ſhould never be in adverſity, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 30. 6, 7.

                  <p n="2">1. To preſerve us from, or purge out of us thoſe fooliſh blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and Atheſtical thoughts, whereby Men think to hide their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the dark from his all-ſeeing eye: Thus ſome wickedly reaſoned, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their ignorance and blindneſs, as it ſeems, in that the Lord ſaith; <hi>can any hide themſelves in ſecret places that I ſhall not ſee them?

                  <p n="2">2 It might alſo, and would be powerful to preſerve us, from put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth our hand to iniquity, were it conſidered by us, that he ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into, and knoweth all our works<hi>: and why wilt thou, my Son,</hi> (ſaith the holy Spirit,) <hi>be raviſht with a strange Woman?

1. Herein is ſignified to us in that he ſaith, <hi>[Remember, &amp;c.]</hi> that they had forgot, and we are too apt to forget, how we have received and heard; to ſuffer a forgetfulneſs of the precious blood of Chriſt, and love therein commended, and what Bleſſedneſs we did at firſt partake, and ſpeak of, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 13, 15. with <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 1. hence that admonition, we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things we have heard leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip<hi>:—</hi>for how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation? <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1, 3. and <hi>ch.</hi> 10. 32, 34.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The forgetting, and letting theſe things ſlip out of our minds, is a great and provoking iniquity, and that which leads into all other evils, and brings into a dying and dead condition: This iniquity was that which brought deadneſs on this Angel and Church, and was the reaſon of the imperfection of their works before God, as is here intimated to us: As the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>By this ye are ſaved if ye keep in memory, &amp;c.</hi> So we may ſay on the contrary; this is the high way to bring deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon our ſelves, if we forget the ſufferings of Chriſt, and the love of both Father and Son therein manifeſted, and everlaſtingly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to us; and to expoſe our ſelves to the diſpleaſure of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 9, 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 4.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The calling to remembrance how we have received and heard, is the way to be recovered out of our ſad condition and evils when we are dead, and our works imperfect before God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6. and <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 1, 5. and <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 12, 16. Thus the Apoſtle when he admoniſhes the <hi>Hebrews</hi> not to caſt away their confidence; and is ſetting before them the great danger of drawing back, and departing from the living God, by an evil heart of unbelief, he then exhorts them, to call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the former days in which they were illuminated; as that which was proper to recover and preſerve them from ſuch tranſgreſſions as they were polluted with, or inclined unto in any meaſure, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 77. 10, 11. and 42. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>Such is the graciouſneſs &amp; faithfulneſs of Chriſt to ſuch forgetful hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as that when they have forgotten how they have received and heard, and forgotten him days without number; yet while it is called to day, he is their remembrancer by his Spirit, who hath the ſeven Spirits of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 26. So the Lord in former times was to his people when they forſook him, and lightly eſteemed the rock of their ſalvation<hi>:—</hi>when of the Rock that begat them they were unmindful, and had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten God that formed them. Then he ſaith to them; <hi>Remember the days of old, conſider years of many generations, &amp;c. Deut.</hi> 32. 4, 7, 12, 15.</p>

18. And ſo by another Prophet he ſaith to them: <hi>O my people, what have I done unto thee, and wherein have I wearied thee? teſtify againſt me.

Mica.</hi> 6. 2, 5. So doth our Lord to this Angel and Church: he puts them in, or ſtirrs them up to the remembrance of thoſe things that were, and might again be pleaſant and profitable to them, that ſo they might cauſe them to return to their hearts again, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 4, 6. 32. and this ſhews he hath no pleaſure in the death, and everlaſting deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch dying ones as theſe were<hi>:</hi> [ſee notes on <hi>Chapt.</hi> 2. <hi>Verſe.</hi> 5.]</p>

                  <p>Herein is ſuppoſed and taken for granted, the other were not ſo: <hi>but theſe were worthy;</hi> theſe few were not like the former; they had forgotten how they had received and heard; but theſe few had not ſo done, but held faſt and kept in memory, what had at firſt been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them, to wit, that Chriſt died for the Sins of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> according to the Scriptures; and was buried, and that he roſe again the third day according to the Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 2, 4. and ſo they were ſaved from the errours and pollutions of the reſidue of their Brethren, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 2. that which they heard from the beginning did abide in theſe few, and ſo they continued in the Son, and in the Father, and they were worthy: they are graciouſly reputed as worthy perſons, who keep in a believing mindfulneſs, and high-prizing, the precious ſufferings of Chriſt, and what he hath thereby done for Mankind, and obtained into himſelf; and what an excellent one he is become by means thereof, as theſe things are now reported to us in the glorious Goſpel; and by keeping theſe, they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from defiling their Garments, and had kept them clean<hi>:</hi> and had their converſation as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27.

                  <p>But how is it here ſaid <hi>[they are worthy?]</hi> To that we ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                     <hi>worthy to take the Book, and to open the Seals thereof, for thou waſt ſlain, &amp;c.</hi> and an innumerable company of Angels ſay with a loud voice; <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain to receive power and riches, &amp;c.</hi> Rev. 5. 8, 10, 12. And the Goſpel of Chriſt is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation<hi>:</hi> It highly deſerves to be received, embraced, and entertained by us, becauſe of its truth and goodneſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
                  <p>And in an evil ſenſe, impenitent ſinners are worthy of puniſhment, by way of merit, or demerit; they deſerve what is inflicted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted upon them; they commit things worthy of ſtripes, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 48. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29.

                  <p>But now in ſuch a ſenſe theſe were not worthy, not ſo by way of merit, no not of the leaſt of all God's mercies and truth, as <hi>Jacob</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgteh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10. and much leſs of the greateſt<hi>: John</hi> the Baptiſt confeſſeth, he was not worthy to unlooſe Chriſt's ſhoes latchet, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 27.

                  <p n="1">1. That thoſe who have been foiled by Satan, and over whom ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities have prevailed, may again get the victory over them that led them captives<hi>:</hi> they may overcome at the laſt, who have formerly been overcome, (as <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 19.) even ſuch while it is the day of God's grace and patience, may again recover themſelves, who have been taken captive by Satan at his pleaſure, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. And the way whereby they may recover themſelves, and prevail againſt their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and iniquities is before directed to in <hi>v.</hi> 3.

As the Lord ſaith; <hi>If the wicked will turne from all his ſins that he hath committed, and keep all my ſtatutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not dye: All his tranſgreſſions that he hath committed, they ſhall not be mentioned to him in his righteouſneſs that he hath done he ſhall live.

But this book is not here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſpoken of, for here ſuch a Book of life is ſpoken of, in which the names of overcomers, and after they have overcome are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is alſo a ſpecial Book of life ſpoken of, and mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scripture: And this, I conceive, is twofold. That is to ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One in which ſome Mens names are written, who ſhall not be raiſed in the firſt reſurrection, nor reign with Chriſt on earth; and yet ſhall have eternal life when they are raiſed in the general and ſecond reſurrection<hi>:</hi> Of this Book of life mention is made in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. In which chapter is firſt declared to us, that thoſe that were beheaded for the witneſs of Jeſus, and for the word of God, and which had not worſhipt the beaſt neither his image; neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand yeers<hi>:</hi> But the reſt of the dead lived not again untill the thouſand yeers were finiſhed: This is the firſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5; 6. and then after the thouſand yeers were expired;—he ſaw the dead ſmall and great, ſtand before God<hi>:</hi> and the Books were opened, <hi>&amp;c.—</hi>And whoſoever was not found written in the book of life, was caſt into the lake of fire, <hi>v.</hi> 11. 15. In which Scripture it plainly appears, that there is a Book of life, in which the names of ſome are written, who are not raiſed in the firſt reſurrection, nor ſhall reingn with Chriſt and the Children of the firſt reſurrection; nor yet be caſt into the lake of fire, but ſhall at the laſt day have eternal life. And in this book may be written the names of ſuch little ones as died in their incapacity, and before they came to the uſe of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and who were not circumciſed, or baptized, when time was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded, and liberty given: but their parents, or thoſe under whoſe
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:48916:202"/>
care or charge they were, neglected, or ſtubbornly refuſed. And ſo ſpeaking of this general reſurrection, and after mentioning the book of life, he ſaith: <hi>I ſaw the dead ſmall and great, ſtand before God:</hi> and the ſmall are firſt ſpoken of. And the Lord ſaid to <hi>Abraham</hi> in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times; <hi>the uncircumciſed manchild, whoſe fleſh of his foreſkin is not circumciſed, that Soul ſhall be cut off from his people, Gen.</hi> 17. 12, 14. and ſo ſhall not partake of that inheritance of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed, but not yet performed<hi>:</hi> Becauſe he is cut off from that people. For the neglect hereof, the Lord met and ſought to kill <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 4. 24, 26. howbeit the eternal judgment and laſt reſurrection, they ſhall not miſs of eternal life, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 2, 3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 29, 30. And in this Book of life may be written, the names of ſuch fearers of God amongſt the gentiles, as have not been brought into the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or Church of Chriſt; and who have not had, while in mortal bodies, any diſtinct knowledge of the mediatour, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 34. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 115. 9, 11. who though they are not the ſubjects of that covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> for himſelf and his ſeed, which covenant was confirmed of God in Chriſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8 with <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 9, 13. yet are accepted of God and ſhall partake of eternal life, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 34. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 26, 27. and all their names alſo may be written herein who are converted to Chriſt after his deſcenſion from Heaven, &amp; during his reign with the Children of the firſt reſurrection upon the earth, <hi>Iſay</hi> 65. 20. 22. But we ſhall adde no more to this particular in this place.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is another Book, a more ſpecial book, called the book of life; and the Lamb's book of life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8. and <hi>ch.</hi> 21. 27. In which are written the names of ſuch as believed in Chriſt, as witneſſed by the Prophets in former times<hi>:</hi> and of ſuch as believe in him, as he is now revealed to us by the Apoſtles of the lamb: which is called, the book of the righteous, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 69. 28. and the writing of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael, Ezek.</hi> 13. 9. whoſe names are written in Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. and all, ſuch Children as have been brought into the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Lord, and died before they came to yeers of diſcretion, to chuſe the good, and refuſe the evil: <hi>for of ſuch is the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 13, 14. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 13, 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 15, 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 16, 18. with <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 12, 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We come next to conſider and ſhew, that it is poſſible that ſome Mens names may be blotted out of the Book of life. And ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Men's names may be blotted out of the general Book of life, and

are ſo, if they continue in their ignorance of God, or diſobedience to his Goſpel, till the day of God's patience beat an end towards them: So the Lord ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever hath ſinned againſt me, him will I blot out of my book, Exod.</hi> 32. 33. And the Pſalmiſt imprecates thus; <hi>Let them be blotted out of the Book of the living, and not be written with the righteous, Pſ.</hi> 69. 28. For though he who deſcended into the lower parts of the earth, who by the grace of God taſted death for every man, be now aſcended up on high, and hath led captivity captive, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived gifts for Men, yea for the rebellious alſo, that the Lord God might dwell among them<hi>:—</hi>yet he will wound the head of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the hairy ſcalp of ſuch an one as goes on ſtill in his treſpaſſes, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 68. 18, 21. his Spirit will not always ſtrive with Men, nor will he ſtill hold open the door, but will riſe up and ſhut it, and then there will be no more opening, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 25, 26.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Before thy Feet,]</hi> that is to ſay, they ſhall worſhip them, not with a Religious or Divine Worſhip; but they ſhall reverence them, and bow themſelves before them, as inferiours before ſuperiours; ſo what is ſaid in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. <hi>I fell down to worſhip before the Feet of the Angel,</hi> is thus expreſt in <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 8. <hi>I fell at his Feet to Worſhip him:</hi> Indeed, that worſhip of the Apoſtles was forbidden, becauſe it was done with a divine worſhip<hi>:</hi> But that informs us, that to worſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ones Feet, and to worſhip that perſon, may mean, one and the ſame thing.

                  <p>And of this he gives his people great aſſurance, as is intimated in his doubling the expreſſion <hi>[I will make them, I will make them.]</hi> which ſignifies to us, the eſtabliſhment hereof, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 32. and that it ſhall certainly be performed in its due time and ſeaſon: compare <hi>Exod</hi> 3. 7. with <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 34. and this he now propoſes to his people to comfort them, and to ſtrengthen them to a patient enduring their troubles, afflictions and reproaches; that he will aſſuredly and certainly in due time cut off all the horns of the ungodly, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 75. 10. and bring them under who are now enemies to his people, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 37. 1, 13. that they might truſt in him, in whom is everlaſting ſtrength<hi>: For he bringeth down them that dwell on high, the lofty city he layeth it low, he layeth it low even to the ground, he bringeth it even to the duſt: the foot ſhall tread it down, the feet of the poor, the ſteps of the needy, Iſay</hi> 26. 3, 4, 5, 6. and <hi>ch.</hi> 35. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>And he who giveth this aſſurance to them is, he that is holy, pure from all, and all manner of iniquity, that hates all the works of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 9. and will therefore gather out of his Kingdome all things that offend, and them which do iniquity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 40, 42. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 4. and he that is true and faithful in all he hath ſpoken and promiſed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 26, 27. and <hi>ch.</hi> 22. 1. 6.

                  <p n="1">1. In that he ſaith, <hi>hold [that] faſt [which thou haſt,]</hi> he ſignifies to us, that the believers ſhould never embrace, or entertain another do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but keep and hold that faſt which they have already<hi>:</hi> They ſhould not have itching ears, to heap up other teachers to themſelves, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive other inſtructions which cauſe to erre from the word of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3, 4. But ſhould let that abide in them which they have heard from the beginning: And hold faſt that form of doctrine, that form of ſound words, which they have heard, in Faith and love which is in Chriſt Jeſus<hi>:</hi> That good thing which was committed to them, they ſhould keep by the Holy Ghoſt which dwelleth in them,

1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 24. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13, 14. Chriſt lays no greater, nor other bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon them, but that they ſhould hold faſt what they have, to wit, his Goſpel. [See notes on <hi>ch.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25.] By this they are ſaved, if they hold faſt what Chriſt's Apoſtles have preached, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1, 3. And if an Angel from Heaven preach to them any other Goſpel than what Chriſt's Apoſtles have preached, and they have received, they ſhould be accurſed to them, <hi>Gal</hi> 1. 8, 9. hence the Apoſtle exhorts the believing <hi>Coloſſians</hi> thus: <hi>As ye have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, walk in him; rooted, and built up in him, and ſtabliſhed in the faith as ye have been taught,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8 and how Jealous was he, leſt the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſhould liſten unto, or entertain any other Goſpel beſides that they had preached, and the believers had received! ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Then from hence we may conclude, that when any would perſwade us to liſten unto, and embrace ſome other doctrines, they are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in led of God: ſuch a perſwaſion comes not of him that calleth the believers, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 7, 8. with <hi>ch.</hi> 1. 6, 7. But it comes from Satan, whoſe work it is to turn them from the Faith, if he can poſſibly do it, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 7, 12. The Holy Ghoſt inſtructs his Children, not to meddle with them that are given to change, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 21. Chriſt calls upon his to hold faſt what they have, and not to be turned therefrom by any ſpecious pretences, or pretenders whatſoever: The Apoſtles have written no new commandment unto us, but an old commandment, which is alſo new; as to the declaration of the actual accompliſhment of that in the perſonal body of Chriſt, which was propheſyed of from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and as to the revelation of thoſe things which were formerly more hidden and myſterious, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may alſo note again, if we conſider the perſons to whom this counſel and exhortation is given<hi>:</hi> That thoſe who have kept the word of Chriſt, need to be counſelled and exhorted ſtill to hold it faſt<hi>:</hi> ſo it was here; our Lord who is holy and true faith, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>thou haſt kept my word, and haſt not denied my name:</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt kept the word of my patience, &amp;c.</hi> and now he ſtill exhorts them; <hi>hold that faſt which thou haſt:</hi> ſo oft-times commandments of like nature are given to them, who have kept the word of God, and Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 24. 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 9 yea this is the burden, as we have ſaid, that he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon ſuch, and no other burden will he lay upon them, but that which they have already they hold faſt untill he comes<hi>:</hi> [ſee the notes on <hi>ch.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 24. and <hi>v.</hi> 25.] and the hearty believers need ſtill to be thus exhorted, and to ſuffer the word of exhortation; And that,—</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That the work of thoſe that endeavour to draw us from Chriſt, is, to deprive and bereave us of our Glory and Crown; <hi>The Thief comes not but to kill, and to ſteal, and to deſtroy,</hi> Joh. 10. 10. <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 24, 27. and <hi>ch.</hi> 9. 13, 18. their end is deſtruction, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19.

He ſhall be preferred before little ones, of whom yet is the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and before ſuch as have not had any conſiderable trials, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and ſo, no ſuch occaſion to fight: for our light affliction which is but for a moment, works for us a farmore exceeding and eternal weight of Glory: <hi>while we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17, 18. he that overcometh ſhall be exalted above others, as the pillar is above the earth generally: and as now their ſufferings for Chriſt do abound, ſo then alſo their conſolations by Chriſt ſhall anſwerably abound, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A pillar,]</hi> By which the King will ſtand, and with whom he will be preſent for ever<hi>:</hi> as it is ſaid in our types: Behold, the King ſtood by the the pillar (in the Temple) as the manner was, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 4,

14. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 13. and <hi>Joſiah</hi> ſtood by a pillar in the houſe of the Lord, 2 <hi>King,</hi> 23. 2, 3.

But it is poſſible Men may not abide in Chriſt, and then Satan and his inſtruments may get their advantage againſt them, as hath been ſhewn before. But hereafter, they that overcome ſhall be like pillars gloriouſly: they ſhall be ſo eſtabliſhed, that they ſhall not poſſibly depart, or be removed from Chriſt, or his Temple: they ſhall be like the pillars in our types, which were ſet in the porch of the Temple: whereof the name of the one was called <hi>Jachin,</hi> that is, he ſhall eſtabliſh<hi>:</hi> and the name of the other <hi>Boaz,</hi> that is, in it is ſtrength, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 21.

In this glorious Temple he ſhall hereafter be a Pillar, not of, or in this World; for Chriſts Kingdom is not of this World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 36.

and mourning; As is ſignified in ſaying, <hi>They that ſow in tears ſhall reap in joy: he that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious ſeed, ſhall doubtleſs come again with rejoycing, &amp;c. Pſ.</hi> 126. 5, 6. <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 11. when God opens a door of utterance, a great and effectual door, there are many adverſaries, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 9. much oppoſition they meet withall from them whoſe good they ſeek, and are oft times in great pain<hi>:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their winning Souls, and bringing them in to Chriſt is called travail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. plowing, <hi>&amp;c. Luke</hi> 9. 62. But when they have once overcome, when that work is over and finiſhed, then they enter into peace, and reſt in their beds, each one walking in his uprightneſs, and before him: then they reſt from their labours, and their works follow with them, <hi>Iſay</hi> 57. 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. then they enter into reſt and ceaſe from their own works, as God did from his, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4 10. they ſhall then gloriouſly be Prieſts to God, and ſhall ever dwell in his houſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 6. with <hi>Pſ.</hi> 84. 4. and ſhall ſtand before him continually, and miniſter to him: they ſhall ſerve him day and night in his Temple: And he that ſits on the Throne ſhall dwell among them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 14, 15.</p>

Now is their time for fighting, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 4. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12.

                  <p n="3">3. They now too oft go out, and wander from Chriſt and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;

wander out of the way of underſtanding, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 16. <hi>Depart out of Chriſt, or do not abide in him; for whoſoever abideth in him ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, doth not commit ſin,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 5, 6. too too oft they go aſtray, by walking after the carnal-mind in them, and wander from Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Hill, forgetting their reſting place, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 23. 3. and 119. 176. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 6. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 116. 1, 7. <hi>Ezek</hi> 24. 12, 13. and too many of the Church of Chriſt do go out perſonally from, and leave his Fold, that were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 19. And as it is ſaid of ſome of Chriſt's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, yea many of them, they went back, and walked no more with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 60, 66. But then there ſhall be no more going out, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 144. 14. But they ſhall dwell in the Houſe of the Lord for ever, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 23. 6. Surely they ſhall not be moved for ever, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 112. 3, 6. He ſhall then be a Pillar for ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>And I will write upon him the name of my God.]</hi> In this reſpect he ſhall be a Pillar alſo, as is before ſaid; <hi>A Pillar to write upon:</hi> And ſo we have to conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The perſon that will write, <hi>[I]</hi> to wit, Jeſus Chriſt, he who is holy, he who is true, he will do it, who is the ready writer, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 45. 1. This will be the time when he writes up the people, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 87. 6. where he firſt ſaith: <hi>Of</hi> Zion <hi>it ſhall be ſaid, this and that Man was born in her, and the higheſt himſelf ſhall eſtabliſh her:</hi> ſhe ſhall be a pillar, as here, the pillar Jachin; and ſhall go no more out<hi>:</hi> and then it follows, <hi>The Lord ſhall count, when he writes up the people, this Man was born there:</hi> then they ſhall be a pillar; and he will write upon her, and every one in <hi>Zion:</hi> compare, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 87. 5, 6. and 1 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 21. with this place: he will then write, not by inſtruments, as now, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3, 4. But with his own finger, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 18. namely, with his ſpirit: ſo that which is in one Evangeliſt, the Spirit of God, is in another, the finger of God<hi>:</hi> compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 28. with <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 20. with this writer and matter, and not with our Inke, will Chriſt who is Faithful write, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The act here ſpoken of, <hi>I [will write:]</hi> by writing is ſignified to us, the perpetuating the name of God upon them: he will not only put it upon them by word, as the prieſts were to do; as it is ſaid: <hi>They ſhall bleſs the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaying, The Lord bleſs thee and keep thee: and they ſhall put my name upon the Children of</hi> Iſrael, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 23, 27. But he ſhall write it, that it may abide upon them for ever and ever, <hi>Iſay</hi> 30. 8. So <hi>Job</hi> ſignifies, that writing was for perpetuating a thing, when he ſaith<hi>: Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were printed in a Book! That they were graven with an iron Pen, and laid in the rock,</hi>
                     <pb n="450" facs="tcp:48916:227"/>

                  <p n="3">3. The manner how, <hi>[upon him,]</hi> that is to ſay, he will make it very viſible and evident<hi>:</hi> he will not only write it in their hearts and minds, though that he will alſo do doubtleſs, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. But ſo upon them, as that it ſhall be read plainly and clearly of all. Indeed, ſo it is now in ſome firſt-fruits, and in part<hi>:</hi> But then it ſhall be done evidently, fully, and gloriouſly: he will write his Fathers name in their foreheads, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1. and <hi>ch.</hi> 22. 4. Then will be the manifeſtation of the Sons of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19, 21. They ſhall then be like Chriſt, for they ſhall ſee him as he is; and ſo ſhall ſhine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father; Then ſhall ye return and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that ſerves God, and him that ſerves him not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 43. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17, 18. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What will he write? <hi>[the name of my God,]</hi> ſaith he, namely, it ſhall be then put gloriouſly upon them, after ſome ſuch manner, as <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s was upon <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Children, as his and his Children, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably more glorious, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 16. with <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17, 18. and ſo as it ſhall then plainly appear they are the Sons of God. Now they are indeed the Sons of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus: But faith is the evidence of things not ſeen, and therefore it doth not now appear (no not to themſelves fully) what they ſhall be, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 1, 2. But then it ſhall appear, and they ſhall be his Sons gloriouſly; as it is ſaid by God himſelf, <hi>He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he ſhall be my Son, Rev.</hi> 21. 7. <hi>They that ſhall be accounted worthy to obtain that World, and the Reſurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in Marriage; neither can they dye any more, for they are equal to the Angels, and are the Sons of God, being the Children of the Reſurrection,</hi> Luke 20. 35, 36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Yea he that is now feeble among them, at that day ſhall be as</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid; <hi>And the Houſe of</hi> David <hi>ſhall be as God, as the Angel of the Lord before them,</hi> Zech. 12. 8. <hi>Iſay</hi> 62. 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the name of the City of my God</hi> (which is) <hi>New</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which cometh down out of Heaven from my God.]</hi> This he will alſo write upon him that overcometh; ſo as it ſhall be both perpetual and viſible, as is before ſaid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the name of the City of my God, New</hi> Jeruſalem<hi>:]</hi> which may ſignifie unto us, either a glorious place, or a glorious people.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Glorious Place, of which <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in former times, the Old <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was the type. That was a glorious place in former times,

1. An evidence and demonſtration that they were Lukewarme; and is a declaration of the cauſe and reaſon of their Lukewarmeneſs: their high thoughts and conceits of themſelves made them ſo; and ſo there was more hope of a fool (of ſuch as were cold) than of them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 12. when Men are highly conceited of themſelves, and think they are already rich, this will make them grow indifferent, remiſs, and ſlothful; and though they come daily and ſit before God as his people, and ſeem to take delight in aproaching to him, and remain in the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of his people, yet it will make them do what they do, out of cuſtome, and for faſhions ſake, or in ſervice to ſome idol, and will cauſe them to be like a door that turns upon his hinges; it will keep them at a ſtand: and though they go backward and forward like ſuch a door; yet they will at laſt be but where they were at firſt<hi>:</hi> they will not grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt<hi>:</hi> It will hinder them from being hot, from ſuch a prizing of Chriſt as to hate all for his ſake, that they may win him, and be found in him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 12, 16. <hi>The full Soul loatheth the honey-comb, and that cauſeth a Man alſo to wander from his place, as a bird from her neſt, Prov.</hi> 27. 7, 8. Thus it was with <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old; when they were low and mean, and little in their own eyes, and in the day of their eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals; Oh then! what fervency and heat of Spirit and demeanour was found with them? they followed the Lord out of the land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and thorow the wilderneſs, thorow a land of deſarts and pits, thorow a land of drought, and of the ſhadow of death, thorow a land that no Man paſſed thorow, and where no Man dwelt: But when they conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to be rich, and ſaid they were Lords, free perſons, now no longer in bondage, as when they were in <hi>Aegypt:</hi> they were now brought out of the houſe of Servants, (a type of the ſtate of this World) and were become owners, grown rich and increaſed with goods; now they were become poſſeſſours, and had need of nothing: Then their former fervency was gone; they would come no more to him, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook him when he led them by the way, and forgat him days without number; and trimmed their way to ſeek love elſewhere; and yet wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their mouthes, and ſaid, they were innocent, and therefore ſurely his anger ſhould turn away from them; and ſtill flatter'd him with their lips, and called him, my Father and the guide of my youth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 2, 7, 31, 35. Oh! <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled, Mat.</hi> 5. 6. but the full and rich he ſends empty away, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 53.

therefore forgetting the things behind, and reaching forth to the things before, he preſſed toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt; he ran as for his life, and did ſtrive as for an incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Crown: and he inſtructs the believers, who were perfect, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right-hearted, to be like-minded with him; to reckon themſelves to be imperfect as to attainment; That ſo they alſo might run with Patience the race ſet before them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12, 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24, 25, 26.</p>
                  <p>Whereas, on the other hand, when Men begin to take notice of themſelves, and to think too highly of themſelves, and of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and attainments; this cuts off the feet, and makes perſons to be Lukewarme; and when a price is put into their hand for getting wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they have no heart thereto. This high thought of themſelves makes them ſit looſe from Chriſt; and though it blow up Men like a bladder, yet it doth not build them up<hi>:</hi> according to that, we all know we have knowledge<hi>:</hi> knowledge (even the knowing and taking notice of our knowledge) puffeth up, as with wind, but it edifieth not as charity doth, which is not puffed up<hi>:</hi> and when Men are puffed up by their fleſhly mind, it takes them off from an high eſtimate of Chriſt, and cauſes them to wander from him, and not to hold the head: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. with <hi>ch.</hi> 13. 4. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18, 19. It is much to be feared, that we alſo have too high conceits of our ſelves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though we are not quite cold, yet ſuch thoughts make us Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme: Oh that we might come to the light of the Lord, and therein ſee, and examine our ſelves; and if this iniquity be with us, put it far away: for this thinking too highly of our ſelves is that which is the cauſe of our loath ſome temper.</p>

                  <p>The Gold here ſpoken of is not natural Gold, nor the Riches of this World: for the poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> could not buy this in a natural ſenſe. Nor doth Chriſt rebuke and chaſten Men for being without natural Gold ſimply<hi>:</hi> Nor doth he give ſuch ſerious counſel to his Churches,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:48916:243"/>
to buy ſuch a corruptible thing; nor need we be ſo earneſtly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled to labour for this periſhing Gold; we are all too naturally encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereto, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 4. Yea a Man may be poor enough, though he had the whole World<hi>:</hi> but here Chriſt ſpeaks about ſpiritual and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, that which infinitely ſurpaſſed the moſt pure Gold here below. And ſo,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By Gold is here meant Chriſt himſelf, with whom are all dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble riches, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 18. And ſo he is not only ſaid to be girded with fine Gold of <hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Now he in himſelf, and as declared to us in the Goſpel, is called and compared to Gold, to ſignifie to us in general, his preciouſneſs and excellency, that he is moſt enriching: as is alſo ſignified in the end laid down, and propoſed to us, to buy it, that we may be rich. And particularly he is called and compared to Gold,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe as Gold is taken out of the Earth, before it becomes ſo precious, and enriching to us, <hi>Job</hi> 28. 5, 6. So Chriſt died and was taken out of the Earth, that he might become enriching to us<hi>:</hi> Herein indeed there is a diſſimilitude between the natural Gold, and this ſpiritual; the Earth is the original place of the former, but not of the latter: Chriſt came down from Heaven from above: He is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all God bleſſed for ever, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 31. and 6. 38, 51. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. But that he might become unſearchable riches for us, and we might be brought back to God, it was abſolutely neceſſary he ſhould ſuffer, and riſe again from the dead, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 24. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 68. 18. It is the fruit of the earth which is excellent and comely for our eſcape, <hi>Iſay</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 22.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe as Gold is the moſt excellent metal, more precious than Iron, Braſs, Silver, or any other metal, <hi>Iſay</hi> 60. 17. <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. 22. So Chriſt is the moſt excellent one, there is none to be compared to him: He is the beginning, the principal one, the firſt-born from the dead, that in all things, and amongſt all perſons, he might have the pre-eminence, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10, 16. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18, 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 4, 14. and 3. 1, 6. and <hi>ch.</hi> 7. 16, 28. He that cometh from Heaven is above all, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 31. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 13, 18. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4, 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is called and compared to Gold, becauſe as money anſwers all things, in having Gold, tried Gold, a Man may have any thing here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,

                     <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 19. So it's moſt fully and compleatly true here: He that hath Chriſt hath all things, in ſuch manner as he hath him; for with him God gives all things alſo freely, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 35. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son<hi>:</hi> he that hath the ſon hath Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 35, 36. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 10, 11, 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21, 22, 23. and <hi>ch.</hi> 1. 29, 30, 31.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He is called and compared to Gold, becauſe as Gold, eſpecially when tried, is very delightful and deſirable to the Natural Eye, and that with which he heart is affected<hi>:</hi> So Jeſus Chriſt is very amiable to the enlightned Eye of the underſtanding, as he is diſplayed before us in the evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 7, 8. <hi>Iſay</hi> 42. 1. and 45. 22. and <hi>chap.</hi> 65. 1. 2. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 9, 16. and <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 1.</p>

                     </gap>n into the Fire, as that ſignifies great and grievous pains and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings<hi>:</hi> He was tormented (as in the Fire) for our Tranſgreſſions, bruiſed for our iniquities, <hi>&amp;c. Iſay</hi> 43. 4, 5. He is eminently and emphatically called, <hi>the afflicted one, Pſ.</hi> 22. 24.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Tried in the Fire]</hi> ſignifieth, that this Heavenly Gold was proved herein, and appeared to be ſo right and excellent, as that he could and did endure and abide the Fire; and therefore alſo he is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and compared to Gold, becauſe it was one of theſe things, and the firſt-named, that would abide the Fire, <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. 22, 23.

                     </gap>ed, and refined, and came forth as Gold out of the Fire, <hi>Job</hi> 23. 10. Indeed he had never any pollution of his own, or any mixture of Sin cleaving to him<hi>:</hi> He knew no Sin, he did no Sin, there was guile found in his mouth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 22. 2.
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:48916:244"/>
But yet he had our ſins laid upon him: God made him to be ſin for us: The Lord laid on him the iniquities of us all, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>Iſay</hi> 53. 6. and ſo he was by imputation ſpotted, as it were, with our ſpots, and deformed with our afflictions and wrinckles; but he was tried in the Fire; therein and thereby was he purified from our Sins, from the guilt of them, and ſo he is pure: He was manifeſted to take away our Sins, and in him is no Sin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5. and he hath put off all mortality, and weakneſs in his Reſurrection, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. and hath a glorious body now in the Heavens, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20, 21. He now liveth who was dead, and he is alive for evermore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 9, 10. [See the notes before on <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 18. and on <hi>ch.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 8.]</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This Gold is ſaid to be tried, to denote, that this trying work is over and paſt, though the vertue, and glorious fruit of it remains and abides for ever<hi>:</hi> It is not ſaid, Gold <hi>[trying]</hi> but <hi>[tried]</hi> in, or out of the Fire; for (as before is ſaid) he is acquitted of all our Sins imputed to him, and hath overcome, aboliſhed and got rid of all our weakneſs and mortality, and all occaſions of grief and trouble; and is not (as ſome ungodly and antichriſtian Spirits blaſphemouſly affirm) dying in ſome, or in any, in every age of the World: Once, and but once, in the end of the World he appeared, to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 25, 26. Chriſt being raiſed from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him; for in that he died he died unto Sin once, but in that he liveth, he liveth to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 9, 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 8, 16, 25. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the next place conſider we, what is imported to us in the end why he counſels this Angel to buy, which is alſo a powerful motive and argument uſed, to move us to have ſuch an high eſtimate of this Gold, as to buy it at any rate; <hi>[that thou mayeſt be rich.]</hi> In this end is ſignified to us,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That thoſe that have not this Gold tried in the Fire cannot be rich, nor enriched with true riches; but are poor, miſerable creatures in the Eyes of him that judgeth righteouſly; though they have large poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, much Gold, and a multitude of Rubies: Theſe riches here below will not profit in a day of Wrath, or death<hi>:</hi> Will he eſteem thy Riches? No not Gold, <hi>&amp;c. Job</hi> 36. 18, 19. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 4. nor make us partakers of the favour of God, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 7. Though we had never ſuch an abundance of the Gold and Riches of this World, yet we ſhould not upon that account, be rich toward, or with God, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 16, 21.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this end and motive is alſo ſignified to us, that be we never ſo

                  <p n="3">3. In that he ſaith, <hi>that [thou] mayeſt be rich;</hi> it declares and ſhews unto us, the great grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; ſuch was his grace to us, that to this end he became poor, that thorow his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty we might be made rich, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. It was not, nor is, his own good and profit this faithful, and true witneſs aims at but the profit and benefit of others that they may be ſaved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 33. and <hi>ch.</hi> 11. 1. Chriſt once ſuffered for Sins, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the fleſh, but quickened by the Spirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18.</p>

1. The things which this Counſellor further counſels this Angel and Church to buy, and that is, <hi>[White Raiment,]</hi> or White Garments. Here conſider we,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What is this <hi>[White Raiment]</hi> here counſelled unto.</p>
                  <p>In general we may ſay; It is ſuch raiment as is only to be had and bought of Chriſt, and which the people may buy and wear as well as the Angel: and hereby is ſignified to us righteouſneſs, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 8. ſo <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I put on righteouſneſs and it cloathed me,</hi> Job 29. 14. And, <hi>let thy Prieſts be cloathed with righteouſneſs, Pſ.</hi> 132. 9. <hi>Iſay</hi> 61. 10.</p>
                  <p>But now, this righteouſneſs which is the <hi>White Raiment,</hi> is not our own righteouſneſs according to the law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19, 20. But the white raiment here ſpoken of is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The righteouſneſs of God without the law, which Chriſt hath wrought and compleated in himſelf, and is become, who is <hi>Jehovah</hi> our righteouſneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 6. and ſo he is compared to a garment, and believers are inſtructed to put him on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14. and as many as are baptized into Chriſt are ſaid, to have put on Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 23, 24. And Chriſt is, and in him appears, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God<hi>:</hi> and ſo he is become righteouſneſs for us, in taking our nature upon him, and therein being made ſin and a curſe; and ſo taſting death by the grace of God for every Man, whereby righteouſneſs is come<hi>:</hi> God made him to be ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>If righteouſneſs come by the law, then Chriſt hath died in vain, Gal.</hi> 2. 21. In which is implied, that to the end he might bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs, he muſt dye, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24, 26. and he is raiſed again as the publick Man; And ſo he is raiſed for our juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By this <hi>White Raiment,</hi> or thoſe <hi>White garments,</hi> are meant, the fruits of this righteouſneſs believed, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 18.

                  <p>Thoſe more inward, and wrought in the Spirit of the mind by the Spirit in the Teſtimony, in glorifying Chriſt, and taking of his things, and ſhewing unto us, are,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Humility;</hi> This is compared to a garment; <hi>Be ye all cloathed with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12. and this garment theſe needed to buy of Chriſt: for they were lifted up with high thoughts and conceits of themſelves, we have ſeen, <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>

Zeal for God, to be clad herewith as with a cloak, <hi>Iſay</hi> 59. 17. this was that alſo, which this Angel and Church were deſtitute of: they were Lukewarme, and neither cold, nor hot, as we have ſeen before: This was therefore needful to be bought by them, in, and with <hi>humility;</hi> and unleſs that be put on, this cannot be had by us: for while Men have high thoughts of themſelves, and their attainments, this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them to Lukewarmneſs, and hinders them from being zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
                  <p>Bowels of mercy, kindneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are alſo to be put on by his Angels and Churches; not only outward acts of mercy, but bowels of mercy, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12. and theſe garments aptly follow, and are joyned with zeal; for when the love and lovelineſs of Chriſt is ſo known, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and conſidered by us, as to enflame our hearts with love to him; together herewith alſo we are led, and prevailed with, to put on Bowels of mercies, and to be tender-hearted unto all.</p>
                  <p>Meekneſs alſo is to be put on by them as a garment, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>The ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1, 5. and this is joyned with, and put as the conſequent of lowlineſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 2. and of humbleneſs of mind, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12. and meekneſs and lowlineſs of heart were conjoyned in our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 10. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 13, 17.</p>

3. That to the end the wretched and miſerable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may have and partake of this preparation and proviſion, needful it is to buy it, To buy this Gold and white raiment; and that in the preſent time. To buy it namely, to get it into our poſſeſſion: hence whereas in one place the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Get wiſdom and with all thy gettings get underſtanding;</hi> In another place he ſaith, <hi>Buy wiſdom and underſtanding:</hi> compare <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 5, 7. with <hi>ch.</hi> 23. 23. and this is called buying; not as if we had any thing of real, or equivalent worth or value to part with, and give for this moſt excellent proviſion here invited to: But this is called and compared to buying, becauſe we muſt part with ſomething that we may be made partakers of Chriſt<hi>:</hi> we muſt be like the wiſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who when he had found one pearl of great price, he went and ſold all that he had and bought it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 44, 46.

                  <p n="3">3. Yea it is needful to buy in the preſent time, becauſe if the preſent opportunity be neglected and let ſlip by us, we may deprive our ſelves

That to the end the wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked may buy this Gold tried in the Fire, and this White Rayment here commended to us, it is good and needful for them, that they anoint their Eyes, the Eyes of their underſtanding, with Eye-ſalve, with the Teſtimony of Chriſt, that they may ſee; for without this knowledge the Soul cannot be good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 2.

Therefore, becauſe as many as he loves he doth rebuke and chaſten: This he acquaints them with, as that which was proper and powerful to provoke them unto what he exhorts them: When perſons conclude there is no hope, and that God hath no love to them, nor will be favourable any more, this takes them off from exerciſing themſelves to what is good, and makes them reſolve to follow ſtrangers, and to walk after their own devices, and do the imagination of their evil heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 25. and <hi>ch.</hi> 18. 11, 12.

In which is ſignified; that there is an evil and reprovable zeal; but unto ſuch an one he doth not exhort or counſel them.</p>

                  <p>Some there are, and too many, who have a bitter zeal, and are walking in ſtrife, and envying; even biting, back-biting, defameing, and devouring one another: And too too oft they pretend their ſtrife and envying, to be zeal for God: Of this the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, ſaying, <hi>If ye have bitter zeal, or envying, and ſtrife in your hearts, glory not, and lye not againſt the truth:</hi> (ſay not, this is for the glory of God, or proceeds from Heavenly Wiſdom<hi>:</hi> for) <hi>this wiſdom deſcends not from above, but is earthly, ſenſual, devilliſh,</hi> &amp;c.

The voice of the true Shepherd, <hi>Joh,</hi> 10. 3, 4, 16, 27. for in his word his voice comes to us, in which excellent things are declared to us, and true things, concerning his abaſement and ſufferings, and how he hath been tried; and what he hath thereby done for us, and obtained into himſelf, and is become; and what he is now doing, and will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do<hi>:</hi> And in which Teſtimony of Jeſus he is giving good counſel, and wholeſome commands to us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 23. and <hi>ch.</hi> 8. 1, 4, 6, 10, 23. and <hi>ch.</hi> 9. 1, 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18.

The Act requiſite about this object is, <hi>[to hear]</hi> this his voice, as it's here ſaid; <hi>If any Man hear my voice.]</hi> To wit, that which is here called for is, attentively to hear, and to hear with underſtanding, his voice: [See notes on <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 3.] Now herein is ſignified to us,</p>

And this ſhews his great lothneſs and unwillingneſs with the deſtruction of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When he ſends forth his voice to them, he expects from them that they incline their Ear thereto, and hear what he is ſpeaking to them<hi>:</hi> Hence he ſaith, <hi>Hear, for I will ſpeak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips ſhall be right things,</hi> Prov. 8. 4, 6. <hi>Hearken diligently unto me: Encline your Ear and come unto me, hear, and your Souls ſhall live,</hi> Iſay 55. 1, 3.

                  <p n="3">3. It is here ſuppoſed and ſignified to us, that it is poſſible men may not hear, when his voice is to them, in that it is ſaid, <hi>[if] any man hear:</hi> Yea it is too too frequently found, that they to whom he ſpeaks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o turn a deaf Ear unto him; as is ſignified to us in what he ſpeaks of his people in former times<hi>: This thing commanded I them, ſaying, obey my voice, &amp;c. But they hearkened not, nor enclined their Ear.—I ſent unto you all my Servants the Prophets daily, riſing up early, and ſending them: yet they hearkened not unto me, nor enclined their Ear, but hardened their Neck,</hi> Jer. 7. 23, 16. He may cry and call, even lift up his voice unto them, and yet they may, and too many do, ſtop their Ears, and refuſe to hearken to him, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 81. 8, 11. <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 11, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 7, 15. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 58. 5.

                  <p n="4">4. It is alſo ſuppoſed, that any man may hear his voice in due time; for he both ſpeaks unto them, and his word is with power, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 32. <hi>Mica</hi> 2. 7. His voice is a mighty voice, as the ſound of many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 15. The voice of the Lord is powerful: The voice of
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:48916:255"/>
the Lord is full of Majeſty, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 29. And herewith he opens Mens Ears to hear, before he expects from them, or requires of them that they hear: As our Saviour ſaith, <hi>The hour is coming and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live,</hi> Joh. 5. 25. Iſay 42. 18, 20. He prevents all, as they come to years of capacity, ſo as every man might hear his voice, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18, 19. <hi>Job</hi> 33. 16. Though no man is neceſſitated thereto, yet all are in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon capacitated thereto by Jeſus Chriſt: And therefore he thus here ſpeaks and ſaith; if any man hear my voice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing requiſite is, <hi>[and open the Door.]</hi> Namely, of the heart, as we have ſeen. This is further required of, and needful for any man, that he may be made a partaker of the bleſſedneſs here propounded and ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But is it not Chriſts work to open this Door? Is it not ſaid of <hi>Lydia,</hi> whoſe heart the Lord opened that ſhe attended unto the things ſpoken? <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes certainly; it is his work firſtly and preventingly; his grace doth bring Salvation to all in due time, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11. But then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us, that we open unto him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13, 15. So it is his work to open the eyes, <hi>Iſay</hi> 42. 1, 5. But then he ſaith to us, <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved,</hi> Iſay 45. 22. The Lord hathmade the ſeeing Eye; but yet he calls upon us, <hi>Open thine Eyes and thou ſhalt be ſatisfied with Bread,</hi> Prov. 20. 12, 13. It is his work to unſtop the Ear, <hi>Iſay</hi> 35. 5. The Lord hath made the hearing Ear, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 12. But then it's required of us, that we encline our Ear, and come unto him, <hi>Iſay</hi> 55. 1, 3. And indeed, ſo much is ſignified in the Scripture objected, that though he prevents with power, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what is then required of, and expected from us: for thus it ſhould be read, whoſe heart the Lord opened to attend, <hi>&amp;c. Acts</hi> 16. 14.</p>
                  <p>Now here we may note, comparing theſe words with the former,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That before he expects we ſhould open the door, he firſt ſignifies we ſhould hear: Hearing is the one thing, and firſt thing needful to all that is required of us, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 39, 42. To our believing; How ſhall men believe in him of whom they have not heard? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 24. To our coming to Chriſt; <hi>encline your Ear,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and come unto me,</hi> Iſay 55. 1, 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 45. To our receiving inſtruction; hence he firſt ſaith, <hi>hear;</hi> and after, <hi>receive my Inſtruction, and not Silver,</hi> Prov. 8. 6, 8, 10. Joh. 6. 45. To our loving the Lord our God with all our heart, and ſoul, and mind, and ſtrength, and our neighbour as our ſelves, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that he adds this after the former, ſo he inſtructs us; that though hearing be needful, and the firſt thing requiſite; yet not the
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:48916:255"/>
only thing required if Men be hearers only, they will deceive their own ſelves, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 30, 32. hence the Holy Ghoſt commands, <hi>Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, Jam.</hi> 1. 19, 22, 26. this is the deſcription given of him that received ſeed into the good ground: he is ſuch an one as heareth the word, and underſtands it; which alſo beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, <hi>&amp;c. Mat.</hi> 13. 18, 23. hearing is firſt required of us in order unto ſome other thing; as is here ſignified to us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In that he ſaith, <hi>[If any Man hear my voice, and open the door;]</hi> So he gives us to underſtand, That we ſhould then only open the door when we hear his voice: To him the porter openeth, and the ſheep hear his voice, and he calls his own ſheep by name, and leads them out:—and the ſheep follow him, for they know his voice: and a ſtranger will they not follow, but will flee from him, for they know not the voice of a ſtranger, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 3, 5. The beloved ſaith, <hi>Open [to me] my ſiſter, my love, my dove, my undefiled:</hi> And ſaith the ſpouſe, <hi>I roſe to open to my beloved, and my hands dropped with myrrh,</hi> Cant. 5. 2, 5. <hi>I opened to my beloved, v.</hi> 6. <hi>My Son,</hi> ſaith the wiſdom of God, <hi>give me thine heart, Prov.</hi> 23. 26. Though others call never ſo loudly and alluringly, yet ſhut them out<hi>:</hi> ceaſe to hear the inſtructions that cauſe to erre from the words of knowledge, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 27. we ſhould be ſo far from opening our hearts to ſuch voices, as that we ſhould ſtop, and ſhut our ears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t they deceive our hearts with their good words and fair ſpeeches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In ſaying, <hi>[if any Man hear my voice and open, &amp;c.]</hi> So he ſignifies, that though the generality who are called and ſpoken to, do refuſe ſo to do, yet he will take it kindly if any Man, if but one particular perſon, obey his voice, and be not rebellious like the reſt, <hi>Ezek,</hi> 2. 8. he will come in to him<hi>:</hi> he will take them one of a City and two of a family, and will bring them to <hi>Zion, Jer.</hi> 3. 14. Oh then! think not Chriſt will reject becauſe of the paucity or fewneſs<hi>:</hi> ſay not, I will do as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do: But know, if thou art alone in this exerciſe, thou ſhalt be bleſſed in thy deed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 51. and 7. 17. and <hi>ch.</hi> 10. 9. and <hi>ch.</hi> 12. 26.

taken others into the chamber of his heart, though he hath been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the greateſt evils, and have been like <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> yet in hearkening unto him, he will pardon and take away all his iniquity, and receive him graciouſly, <hi>Iſay</hi> 1. 10, 14. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 1, 4. Oh then! let no former unworthineſs of thine hinder or diſcourage thee: But while he calls, and knocks, open the door unto him, and no longer ſtand out, or harden thine heart againſt him; but awake, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 13, 14. and and to engage, move and prevail with us ſo to do, let us conſider that which here followeth, which is propounded as a motive and argument to perſwade, and prevail with us to ſuffer the word of exhortation, and to hear his voice, and open the door; namely,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Bleſſedneſs aſſured to every ſuch an one as doth hear his voice and open the door<hi>: [I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me.]</hi> Now here note in general,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As this Bleſſedneſs contained in thoſe gracious promiſes is propounded to them by Chriſt before they return; ſo it ſhews unto us, That in preaching the Goſpel to any, it ſhould be ſo declared, as therewith the exceeding great and precious promiſes ſhould be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred and propounded to Men, while they ſhut out Chriſt: Thus doth our Lord to them who were ignorant of him, and enemies to him: <hi>Verily, Verily, I ſay unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Joh.</hi> 5. 24, 25. and <hi>ch.</hi> 6. 27, 35, 51, 58. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 20, 23. and <hi>ch.</hi> 8. 32, 35. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. So in former times, when the Lord had been largly declaring the bleſſedneſs of the Servants of the Lord, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing great things to them, he then ſaith; <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters—hearken diligently unto me, &amp;c. Iſay</hi> 54. 13, 17. and <hi>ch.</hi> 55. 1, 3, 6, 8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As this bleſſedneſs is aſſured to him that hears and opens; ſo we may learn, That if we be Chriſt's then are we <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeed, and heirs according to promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16, 29. though the promiſes are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to all in the Goſpel, yet all are not of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16, 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 12, 16. But ſuch as exerciſe themſelves to godlineſs<hi>:</hi> for that is profitable to all things, having promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7, 8. It is a very evil and provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing, to aſſure the promiſes are theirs, and they the heirs of them, who ſhut out Chriſt, and walk in evil and crooked paths; for whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver walks thererein ſhall not know peace: ſee what the Lord threatneth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But, he will come in to them by his Spirit, and riches of grace, and conſolations: in hearing his voice, and opening the door to let that in, he will come in, and the Father alſo<hi>:</hi> like that, <hi>If any Man love me he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him,</hi> Joh. 14. 23. with Iſay 57. 15. <hi>he that abideth in the doctrine of Chriſt he hath both the Father and the Son,</hi> 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.

                  <p n="1">1. We may here then ſee the graciouſneſs of Chriſt, and his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to forget all paſt, in their yet obeying his voice: he will not retain anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in mercy, <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 18. ſee <hi>Luke</hi>

                  <p>4. We have an account given us, of a voice ſpeaking with him: <hi>[And the firſt voice which I heard, was as it were of a trumpet talking with me,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
                  <p>This firſt voice which he heard is ſaid to be,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>As of a trumpet]</hi> A great, loud, and awakening voice: <hi>Lo he ſendeth forth his voice, and that a mighty voice,</hi> Pſal. 68. 33. To ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the weightineſs of that which was ſpoken; and to the end he might attentively hear, and diligently hearken to it: As it is ſaid, hearken to the ſound of the Trumpet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 18. 3 [See the Notes on <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10.] So Chriſt ſpeaks with a mighty voice in his Goſpel, ſo as he cauſes the dead to hear, that they might hear in hearing, and their ſouls live, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1,-3. And commandment is given to <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who bring good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, to get them up into the high mountains, to lift up their voice with ſtrength, to lift it up, and not be afraid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 9, that the Inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, might hear this good news ſo ſounded forth by them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 18. 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This voice, though like a Trumpet, yet was articulate; for it was a voice talking with him; not afrighting, but familiarly, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, and ſociably talking with him: a phraſe oft uſed in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the viſions of God, as <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 9, 13, 14, 19. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 3. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 1, 4, 5, &amp; <hi>c. Rev.</hi> 17. 1. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. 9, 15. Chriſt ſtrengthened his Servant <hi>John</hi> to hear this loud voice ſpeaking to him, and talking with him: And this voice was talking with him, cauſing him to know and underſtand what it ſpake, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 18, 19. It was informing him, and talking with him, as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 22.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider we what the voice ſaid, in theſe following Branches.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Come up hither,]</hi> not only, <hi>come hither,</hi> as <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 1. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. 9, but <hi>come up hither:</hi> And yet it ſeems not to contain ſo much in it, as is contained in the ſame phraſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 12, for that appears to have reſpect to the aſcending of their bodies, to whom it was ſpoken. But, come up, aſcend up, namely, in Spirit; that may be where the body is not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 5. So it is elſewhere ſaid, after the voice thus ſpake to <hi>John,</hi> come hither; he carried me in Spirit, (for it is without an Article,) <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 1, 3. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.

9, 10. And it is as if he ſhould ſay, not only, ſtand up, as being now awakened and excited by this Trumpet, from thoſe dead things here on earth, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light, as, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14. But, aſcend up from all things here below, from all theſe ſeen things, good and evil: mount up in ſpirit like an Eagle to Heaven, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 31.

Mount up to the conſideration and contemplation of things above: So the believers are exhorted generally to do in an ordinary way, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2,—5. And though this voice ſpake to him, and talked with him in, and after an extraordinary way and manner; yet there was an act of compliance required from the Apoſtle, ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 12, as alſo was from <hi>Paul</hi> in order to his being converted; though the Lord appeared to him, and was converting him after an extraordinary manner; yet not in an irreſiſtible manner: Hence he ſaith, I was not diſobedient unto the heavenly viſion: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying he might poſſibly have ſo been, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 19. with, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 1,—14. and <hi>Jona.</hi> 1. 1,—3. So here, the Lord did not carry him up, without any compliance, or obedience on the Apoſtle's part; but he raiſed his ſpirit to go up (as <hi>Ezra.</hi> 1. 9.) and then commanded him, <hi>Come up hither.</hi> And this was a great honour done unto, and favour conferred upon his Servant <hi>John:</hi> If it be a great favour to a man when an earthly Prince, or great man ſhall ſay unto him, come up hither, and ſuch an one ſhall have honour in the preſence of others, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 7, with <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 10. O how much greater and higher an exaltation is it to a Servant of Chriſt, when the King of Heaven, the King of Glory ſhall ſingle him out from, and herein prefer him before the reſidue of his Brethren, in ſaying unto him, come up hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even unto Heaven! Oh now, ſuch have great need to take heed they be not exalted above meaſure; and to conſider, by grace they are ſaved as well as others: And to beware they deſpiſe not ſuch as are not favoured like them herein, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7,—9. It was an excellent thing found with <hi>John,</hi> when he was thus exalted above his brethren; yet he then ſaith; <hi>I John, who alſo am your brother,</hi> &amp;c. [See Notes on <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9.]</p>
                  <p>But how could the Apoſtle give obedience to the call and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this voice? How could he come up thither, or aſcend unto Heaven?</p>
                  <p>Surely, not in any power, ſtrength, or ability of his own; or by any wiſdom, or skill of his: But he that ſpake to, and talked with him, ſtrengthned him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 19. See <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. And there is a
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:48916:262"/>
way by which he extraordinarily, and we ordinarily may aſcend; though we have no power of our ſelves ſo to do, nor can deviſe a way how we might come up: for no man hath aſcended up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in any wiſdom, or ſtrength of his own, as is implied, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 4. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 13. yet we may mount up and aſcend by the help of that ladder ſpoken of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 11, 12. the foot whereof is ſet upon the earth, and the top of it reacheth up to Heaven: And this ladder in the truth of it is, the Son of man, who fell into the ground, and died for our ſins, <hi>John</hi> 12. 24. He deſcended into the lower parts of the earth, into great and wonderful abaſement and ſufferings: He hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, the death of the Croſs: And <hi>He who deſcended, is the ſame alſo who aſcended far above all things, that he might fill, and fulfill, all things, Eph.</hi> 4. 8,—10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 18. This is the ladder we are ſpeaking of; as our Saviour alſo ſignifies, when he ſaith, <hi>Hereafter ye ſhall ſee heaven opened, and the Angels of God aſcending and deſcending upon the ſon of man,</hi> Joh. 1. 51. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 11, 12. He is the ſecret of the ſtairs, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14, upon which we may aſcend into Heaven by faith, and in ſpirit; but we muſt always begin at the bottom, which is upon the earth: that we may ſo do, and ſo go up gradually, from one ſtep to another, we muſt begin at the humiliation, ſufferings, and Croſs of our bleſſed Redeemer: we have liberty <hi>to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus, by a new and living way which he hath conſecrated for us thorow the veil, that is to ſay, his fleſh,</hi> Heb. 10. 19, 20.

                  </p>
                  <p>This is that which the voice further ſpake unto him. In which we may note,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth know things that ſhall come, future things: And this he muſt needs do; for he knoweth all things, <hi>John</hi> 21. 17. <hi>There is no creature that is not manifeſt in his ſig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And though he foreſees (as to us) and knows what will ſinfully be acted and committed, yet he doth not neceſſitate the coming to paſs of it any way. <hi>The juſt Lord will not do iniquity,</hi> Zeph. 3. 5. <hi>He is not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſs, neither ſhall evil dwell with him,</hi> Pſal. 5. 4. Jam. 1. 13, 14, 15. Yea, our Lord Jeſus is ſo far from neceſſitating men to what is ſinful, as that all ſuch actions do grieve him at the heart. He did indeed know and foretell, that <hi>Judas</hi> one of the Twelve would betray him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 64, 70, 71. But he did not neceſſitate him any way ſo to do; but that horrid fact of his was a great grief to our Lord Jeſus. Hence the Evangeliſt ſaith, <hi>Jeſus was troubled in ſpirit;</hi> (and not in his face or outward appearance only; he did not feign himſelf to be grieved, but was in wardly grieved, grieved in ſoul,) <hi>and teſtified and ſaid, Verily one of you ſhall betray me, Joh.</hi> 13. 21. Yea, he is ſo far from neceſſitating men to evil, as that he works powerfully, and his grace brings ſalvation to all men, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them therefrom.

                  <p>Yes certainly; but He and the Father, and the Eternal Spirit are one: <hi>For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one,</hi> one God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 30. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7, 9, 10.

Yea, this is a Rain-bow, to ſignifie to us, that in a day of rain, wrath, affliction, yet then he will be mindful of his Covenant, for a day, or time of rain ſignifies a day of affliction and diſtreſs: As, <hi>All the people ſate trembling for the great rain,</hi> Ezra 10. 10, 13. <hi>The winter is paſt, the rain is over and gone,</hi> Cant. 2. 11. <hi>They have been ſcattered in the cloudy and dark day,</hi> Ezek. 34. 12. <hi>That day is a day of wrath, a day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diſtreſs, a day of waſtneſs and deſolation, a day of clouds and thick darkneſs,</hi> Zeph. 1. 15, 18.

And ſo in the moſt tempeſtuous time, in the moſt ſtormy day, while men are joined to all the living, when <hi>out of the Throne proceed lightnings and thundrings, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 5. When God threatens an univerſal deluge and deſtruction, yet this Bow ſignifies and betokens his faithfulneſs in ſuch a time: When <hi>the Lord revengeth and is furious:—When he hath his way in the whirlewind, and in the ſtorm, and the clouds are the duſt of his feet:—When the mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burnt up at his preſence:—When none can ſtand before his indignation, none can abide in the fierceneſs of his anger; his fury is poured forth like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.

                  <p n="1">1. To denote unto us, that in and through the precious blood of Chriſt, as opened in the preaching of the croſs to us, we may ſee all things aright as in a glaſs, clear as cryſtal. And ſo the knowledg of the Lord is compared to the ſea covered with waters, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 9. and this ſea may be ſaid to be like glaſs, with alluſion to the Laver, or Sea in the tabernacle in former times: as it is ſaid, <hi>Moſes made the Laver of braſs, and the foot of it of braſs, of the looking-glaſſes of the women aſſembling, which aſſembled at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation,</hi> Exod. 38. 8. only that ſea was of brazen glaſſes, this of glaſs clear as cryſtal, more clear than our types, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 11. For the Apoſtles now, in preaching Chriſt crucified, have uſed great plainneſs of ſpeech, and not as <hi>Moſes,</hi> who put a vail over his face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſignifie the darkneſs and obſcurity of his Miniſtration; and <hi>now we all with open face, as in a glaſs, may behold the glory of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 12, 13-18. In this red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea of Chriſts blood, we may perceive and behold the kindneſs and pity of God to manward; which love of his is alſo compared to a Laver, and called the <hi>Laver of regeneration,</hi> Tit. 3. 4, 5. <hi>God is love. In this was manifeſted the love of God, becauſe that God ſent his only begotten ſon into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love</hi> (to be always ſeen and perceived) <hi>not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his ſon the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 8, 9, 10. In this glaſs we may alſo ſee the vileneſs and odiouſneſs of our ſins unto God, in that he hath ſo ſeverely condemned them in the fleſh of his own Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. and there taken ſuch vengeance on our inventions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 2. and here we may ſee our ſelves as in a glaſs, and what manner of perſons we are, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 23, 24. and ſee what miſerable ones we are by nature, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If one died for all, we judg, then were all dead,</hi> dead at Law, condemned to dye, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. yea, and herein we may ſee the world, the weakneſs and unprofitableneſs thereof; by the croſs of Chriſt the world is crucified unto him that glories in it, and he unto the world, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14. Hereby the Holy Spirit doth convince the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment; and doth teach the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all things, and guide them into all truth, <hi>John</hi> 16. 8, 11, 14. Hence the Apoſtle determined to know nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> elſe (among the <hi>believing-Corinthians,</hi> in and unto all things) <hi>ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2, 2. and chap. 1. 18, 23, 24. And this Sea is before the throne,

and ſo in the view of the four living creatures, that they may therein behold God, <hi>John</hi> 12. 45. and his and his Sons wonderful loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the children of men, and that they may ſee themſelves in it. And it is in the view of the Elders alſo, that his perſonal abaſement and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings may alſo be remembred, and he admired, praiſed, and bleſſed by them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 8, 9. And in the view of the Angels alſo, into which blood and excellent ſufferings they deſire to look and pry, as in a cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal glaſs. Compare 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11, 12. with <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 23, 25. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ſea is of glaſs like unto cryſtal, to denote its clearneſs and purity; ſo it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhewed me a pure river—clear as cryſtal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 1. and ſo the blood of Chriſt is ſaid to be precious and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible; it being the blood of Chriſt <hi>as of a lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. and ſo as referring to the ſea or laver in former times; this ſea like unto cryſtal, is the fountain opened to waſh in, to waſh away our filth and uncleanneſs, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1. So the typical Laver or Sea was for the Prieſts to waſh in; as it is ſaid by God to <hi>Moſes, Thou ſhalt make a laver of braſs—and thou ſhalt put water there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: for Aaron and his ſons ſhall waſh their hands and their feet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: when they go into the tabernacle of the congregation; they ſhall waſh with water that they dye not,</hi> Exod. 30. 18, 21. and chap. 40. 30, 32. 2 Chron. 4. 6. where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>1. What are theſe <hi>[four living creatures],</hi> or living wights? We read them indeed in our Tranſlation, <hi>Beaſts;</hi> but the word is not well tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated ſo: nor is it very proper to ſay, one beaſt had the face of a man, and another like an Eagle, which is a fowl. But we ſhall here and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards read the word <hi>living creatures,</hi> with alluſion to the four living creatures ſpoken of in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> viſions, chap. 1. and chap. 10, &amp;c. which in former Tranſlations were rendered alſo <hi>beaſts,</hi> but in our laſt, <hi>living creatures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Now by theſe living creatures are meant in general,</p>
                  <p>1. Men, and not ſpirits by nature; ſome of Mankind, of that kind of ſpecies of creatures, as doth evidently appear in chap. 5. 8, 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that they with praiſe and thankfulneſs confeſs and acknowledg unto the Lamb, that he had redeemed them unto God by his blood. In which is implied, that he had dyed, or as is there expreſt, was ſlain, and was riſen for them, and gave himſelf a ranſom to God for them, as he hath done for all men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4, 6. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. and ch. 4. 4, 5. but not ſo for the Angels; <hi>for he took not on him the nature of angels,</hi> or laid not hold on Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 10, 11. and in that place alſo it is ſaid by the living creatures, <hi>Thou haſt redeemed us unto God by thy blood;</hi> that is, he had redeemed or bought them, through the diſcovery of his precious blood in the Goſpel, from their vanities and vain converſation, as <hi>Acts.</hi> 20. 28. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19. like that which is ſaid of the hundred forty and four thouſand, they were redeemed from the earth, they were redeemed from among men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They were alſo redeemed out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation, chap. 5. 9. which cannot be affirmed of the Angels thoſe miniſtring ſpirits.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They alſo acknowledg to the praiſe of the Lamb, <hi>Thou haſt made us unto our God kings and prieſts, and we ſhall reign on the earth,</hi> chap. 5. 10. like that ſaid chap. 1. 5, 6. and chap 20. 6. which ſhews them to be men, and not Angels by nature: for theſe kings, prieſts, and reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are ſuch as ſhall be raiſed from the dead, before they ſo reign, or are gloriouſly kings and prieſts, as doth evidently appear in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4, 5, 6.</p>

4. Theſe living creatures are diſtinguiſhed from the Angels, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 10, 11. yea, from all the angels; and the angels are ſaid to be about them, chap. 7. 11. and chap. 5. 11. and they are diſtinguiſhed from all ther creatures, from every creature which is in heaven, and in the earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea, and all that are in them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 13, 14. therefore it moſt evidently appears, that theſe living creatures are ſome of mankind.</p>
                  <p>2. And they are alſo ſignified to be, not the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, which are dead to us; but to be ſuch as are alive in mortal bodies, as hath been ſaid before. [See the Notes on <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. of this Chapter.] And this appears by the name given to them, in that they are always called <hi>living ones</hi> or <hi>living creatures,</hi> when they are named with the Elders; and ſo generally in Scripture, the living are ſuch as live to and with us. Hence the Earth of this world is oft-times called the <hi>land of the living,</hi> Job 28. 13. Pſal. 27. 13. and 52. 5. and 56. 13. and 116. 9. and 142. 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 11. 19, &amp;c. And many times the living are diſtinguiſhed from, and oppoſed to thſoe that are dead to us, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 48. <hi>Ruth.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And theſe living creatures alſo appear to be ſuch as have not yet finiſhed their courſe, nor reſted from their labours; becauſe it is ſaid of them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>They have wings; and they have no reſt day and night:</hi> whereas of the Elders it is ſaid, <hi>They are ſitting upon their ſeats, or thrones, as thoſe that have entred into reſt,</hi> Verſ. 4.</p>
                  <p>3. And as diſtinguiſhed from the Elders, as theſe living creatures are in many places; ſo they appear to be ſuch as are younger than the Elders, and younger ones, as compared to them, unto whom they ſhould ſubmit in the Lord, and for his ſake, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. even the ſpiritual children of the Prophets <hi>(Acts</hi> 3. 25.) and Apoſtles; as many times the Apoſtles call the Believers to whom they write, their children, and little children: as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15, 16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1. 18. 28. and 3. 17, 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As having believed on Chriſt, and God by him thorow their word, <hi>John</hi> 17. 20 and ſo they are thoſe which are called the ſeeds ſeed; as <hi>Iſa</hi> 59. 21. And ſo by theſe living creatures here ſpoken of,</p>
                  <p>And particularly, I conceive, are meant, the Church of the living God; that part of it, I mean, which is on earth (for both the Saints which are in Heaven, and thoſe that are on earth, are but one family, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 15.) which is by faith, <hi>come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 12. 22, 23. The Church of Chriſt on Earth in general, as a body, the myſtical body of
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:48916:283"/>
Chriſt, united by a ſpiritual and unſeen bond, even by the ſpirit of faith unto Chriſt, as their only head and husband, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 32. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18. and by the ſpirit of love one to another, as members of the ſame ſpiritual body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 25. And in this Church there may be had, in this place, principal, but not only reſpect to the faithful, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, painful, and laborious teachers, angels, or overſeers amongſt them, who watch for the ſouls of others, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. And theſe, all hearty and unfeigned believers in the Church on earth, and as the Church are; <hi>the living the living, that ſhall praiſe him, and make known his truth to them that are on the earth,</hi> Iſa. 38. 18, 19. the ſeed that ſhall ſerve him, and whom he will preſerve, which ſhall be <hi>counted to the Lord for a generation,</hi> Pſal. 22. 30, 31. And this may alſo appear to be meant by the four living creatures, by that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 10. which we read, <hi>Thy congregation hath dwelt therein:</hi> The ſeventy two Interpreters (uſually called the ſeventy, and whoſe tranſlation our Saviour and his Apoſtles very frequently make uſe of) thus render it, <hi>Thy living creatures have dwelt therein,</hi> uſing the ſame word which the Apoſtle doth here, and elſewhere frequently in this book: which alſo ſhews, that by theſe four living creatures, are meant, Gods congregation on earth, his Church, the body of Chriſt, or that part of it which is on earth in a general and conjunct conſideration. And this underſtanding of the four living creatures, to ſignifie the Saints on earth as a body, and in a general conſideration, affords Anſwer to the Objections of ſome, againſt the ſenſe given, and may deliver and preſerve us from the miſtakes of others concerning theſe living creatures. For ſay ſome,</p>
                  <p>Object. 1. <hi>That the hundred forty and four thouſand ſealed Saints, in</hi> Chap. 7. 4, 8. <hi>And the great multitude of the Gentile believers, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned alſo in</hi> Chap. 7 9, 10. <hi>are diſtinguiſhed from the living creatures, in that ſame Chapter,</hi> Verſ. 11. <hi>And that the hundred forty and four thouſand in</hi> Chap. 14. 1, 3. <hi>ſing a new ſong before the four living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; therefore ſurely they are diſtinct from them, and the four living creatures mean not the whole Church of Chriſt upon earth.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> What hath been already ſaid, gives Anſwer unto this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection however in ſome good meaſure. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We look upon the four living creatures, to ſignifie, as is ſaid, the Church here in general, and as a woman and mother; and the ſealed Saints, and all particular believers as her children, and ſo in a diſtinct conſideration, as members thereof in particular, while they are here on earth; ſuitable to that diſtinction made by the Apoſtle
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:48916:283"/>
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> when he, ſpeaking of the Church, ſaith, <hi>Now ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 27. ſo the woman and her children, or ſeed, are diſtinctly mentioned in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 17. and ſo are alſo <hi>Zion</hi> and her children, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 14, 17, 21. and <hi>chap.</hi> 54. 6-13. though in another ſenſe they are of <hi>Zion</hi> alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. 5. ſo here, as we have before ſaid, we underſtand by the four living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Jehovah's</hi> congregation on earth, in a general ſenſe and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and as a mother; and the ſealed Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as her ſeed, children, and members in particular.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But it doth appear alſo, that the ſealed Saints, as mentioned in <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. 1. and the multitude of believers, in <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 9, 10. are ſuch as have dyed in the faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time, and not of any perſons alive in mortal bodies.

                  <p>Object. 2. <hi>Others ſay, that by the four living creatures, are not meant the Church on earth; but that hereby are meant four of the Apoſtles of the Lord and Saviour: though there be a difference amongſt them, as to theſe four alſo, who are of this mind; ſome ſuppoſing them to be the four Evangeliſts; ſome conceiving them to be others, or ſome others of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But theſe living creatures cannot mean four Apoſtles, or Evangeliſts, nor any four individual perſons whatſoever.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe theſe four living creatures, as living creatures, are in viſion, ſignified to continue until Chriſt come to take to him his great power, and to reign: ſee <hi>chap.</hi> 19. 1-4. which will be after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>myſtery Babylon;</hi> and then, after that, there is no more mention of four living creatures; but no four indivdual perſons ever lived, or live ſo long in mortal bodies: And to be ſure, not four A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, or Evangeliſts; for they were all dead but <hi>John,</hi> before this Revelation was ſent and ſignified unto him.

                  <p>Object. <hi>But ſome may object and ſay, This interpretation is contrary to what you have ſaid on</hi> ver. 4. <hi>of this Chapter,</hi> viz. <hi>that the elders are more excellent than the living creatures; and now you ſeem to oppoſe that in ſaying, The living creatures are placed neerer the throne than the elders; and it is generally ſuppoſed and concluded, that the moſt excellent are next the throne.</hi>

Though what is ſaid in the Objection, be indeed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally concluded, yet it is not univerſally true therefore: it is ſo indeed, as with reſpect to the lamb, who is next the throne, and who is the one and only mediatour, as we may ſee, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 6. but not ſo as to others about the throne. And theſe living creatures may not be placed ſo neer the throne to ſhew their excellency above the Elders, nor are they upon this account ſo placed; <hi>for the elders are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than theſe;</hi> nor doth their being thus placed or diſpoſed, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily prove any ſuch thing; for it is ſaid, <hi>The angels are round about the throne, and about the elders, and the four living creatures;</hi> and ſo more remote, and further off from the throne in this viſional repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 11. and <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 11. and yet neither theſe nor thoſe are ſimply more excellent than the Angels; nor will they be equal to them till the reſurrection of the juſt, as it appears by our Saviours ſaying, <hi>viz.

                  <p>2. But theſe four living creatures may be ſo diſpoſed upon another account, namely, to denote Gods peculiar care of, and tendring them in their great infirmity and weakneſs, and amidſt the many dangers and enemies they are annoyed and ſurrounded with; from which the Elders and Angels are free, and delivered. Even as a loving and tender-hearted parent carries his little child in his arms, and places it next to himſelf, not to ſignifie its excellency above its elder brethren, but in pity and compaſſion to it, and to preſerve it from falls and dangers, whereto it is more liable than the reſt of its brethren: ſo it is here; ſo Chriſt as a gracious and careful ſhepherd, takes thoſe of his flock which are weakeſt, neereſt to him, not to ſignifie, that they are more excellent than the more ſtrong; but to ſhew his abundant

That the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect (as the four and twenty Elders do ſignifie: ſee the notes before on <hi>ver.</hi> 4.) do fall down and worſhip God; though in ſpirit they are compleatly entred into reſt, yet they never ceaſe from worſhipping and adoring him that ſits on the throne: but this exerciſe of theirs remains for ever, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 14. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 16, 17. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 14, 15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 39, 40. yea and when they are raiſed again in the firſt reſurrection, they ſhall be Prieſts
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:48916:302"/>
of God and of Chriſt; they ſhall then praiſe, and glorifie him as the object of their adoration, who liveth for ever and ever, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. 6. they ſhall be his Sons ſtill, and ſo ſhall honour him as their Father, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. 7. with <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6. as it is ſaid, <hi>There ſhall be no more curſe, but the throne of God and of the lamb ſhall be in it, and his ſervants ſhall ſerve him, and they ſhall ſee his face,</hi> &amp;c. Chap. 22. 3, 4. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 20. Though then they ſhall be equal to the Angels, yet they ſhall not be exempt from giving this Homage to the Supreme and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord of Heaven and Earth; for the <hi>Seraphims,</hi> as we have ſeen, cry one to another, <hi>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hoſts,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 6. 1-3. And it is ſaid <hi>All the angels ſtood round about the throne—and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped God ſaying, Amen: Bleſſing, and glory, and wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be unto our God for ever and ever, Amen,</hi> Chap. 7. 11, 12. Dan. 7. 10. And the Prophet calls upon them to worſhip the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Bleſs the Lord ye his angels that excel in ſtrength, that do his Commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word: Bleſs the Lord all ye his hoſts, ye miniſters of his that do his pleaſure: Bleſs the Lord all ye his works in all places of his dominion,</hi> Pſal. 103. 19, 20, 22. And if the inhabiters of Heaven do worſhip and adore him that ſits upon the throne, as we have ſeen they do; then we may thereby diſcern the wickedneſs and wretchedneſs of their boaſts of perfection, as to attainment, who caſt off all fear of God; and, as they ſay, are above all his ordinances and appointments; and look on the adoration of the Lord God Almighty, as a thing below and beneath them. Alas, this is far from perfection; and herein they are moſt like the Devil; and it proceeds from their great pride, as it is ſaid, <hi>The wicked thorow the pride of his countenance, will not ſeek after God: God is not in all his thoughts,</hi> Pſal. 10. 4. Theſe are like unto thoſe of whom <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, who ſay unto God, <hi>Depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledg of thy ways: what is the Almighty that we ſhould ſerve him?</hi> Job 21. 14, 15. Exod. 5. 2.</p>
                  <p>As this Verſe relates unto <hi>ver.</hi> 9. ſo we may learn from hence, that there is a communion of Saints, of the holy Ones above in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and the Saints that are in the earth; when thoſe which are here below give glory, honour, and thanks to the Creator of all things; then theſe which are in Heaven, fall down, and worſhip him alſo: they are both but one family, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 15. And thoſe below are by faith come unto theſe above, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22-24. And when the one worſhip God, the other alſo joyn with them therein: as in our types, when the <hi>prieſts burnt incenſe within, in the temple of the Lord; the whole multitude of the people were praying without,</hi> Luk. 1. 9, 10. and
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:48916:302"/>
they both of them worſhip the ſame object of worſhip, as evidently appears by comparing the two Verſes; they above do not worſhip one, and thoſe below another: thoſe below do not worſhip theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; but they have all one Father and God: Indeed thoſe below have ſuch mediums and ordinances, and helps in government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as theſe above need not, and ſuch bodily poſtures, places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as to the things which are abſolutely eſſential to the worſhip of God, they have fellowſhip together.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But now ſome may and do object from the order of words in</hi> ver. 9. <hi>and</hi> 10. <hi>againſt the interpretation given of the Elders and living creatures, and ſay, It appears that the living creatures are the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, becauſe they always begin, and are firſt, and firſt mentioned in the worſhip of God; as alſo</hi> chap. 5. 8, 9. <hi>therefore they are more excellent than the Elders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To this I ſay in general; though I cannot give ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to others, nor anſwer all the Objections that may be made and urged againſt the ſenſe foregiven; yet it appears to me ſo evident, that the Elders, as the word imports, are the moſt excellent, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, and are the repreſentative of that part of the Church above; and the four living creatures do mean and ſignifie the younger, and thoſe alive in mortal bodies, even the Church of Chriſt in the four quarters of the world, generally conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; that I ſhall not be readily waved from that interpretation given, though I could not ſatisfactorily anſwer all mens Queſtions or Objections there-againſt.</p>
                  <p>2. But more particularly we may ſay to this Objection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not true, that the living creatures are always firſt named, or placed in the worſhip of God; for though here they are firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and in <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 8, 9. yet they are not ſo every-where; nor is this order always obſerved: for in <hi>chap.</hi> 19. 4. it is ſaid, <hi>And the twenty-four Elders, and the four living creatures fell down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped God that ſate on the throne, ſaying, Amen, Allelujah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor is it true, that they are always the moſt excellent, who are firſt mentioned in worſhipping; for both the living creatures and Elders are mentioned before the innumerable company of Angels, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 8, 9, 11, 12. and all creatures before the living creatures and elders, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 13, 14. and the innumerable multitude, which are <hi>clothed with white robes, and had palms in their hands, before all the Angels,</hi> Chap. 7. 9, 11.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="630" facs="tcp:48916:303"/>
3. Nor doth any ſuch thing here neceſſarily appear, as is ſuppoſed, and taken for granted in the objection, <hi>viz.</hi> that the living creatures do begin in the adoration of him that ſits upon the Throne; but when the living creatures give glory, honour, and thanks; <hi>The four and twenty Elders fall down,</hi> &amp;c. like that, <hi>When the living creatures went, the wheels went by, or with them: and when the living creatures were lift up from the earth, the wheels were lift up: for one ſpirit acted them both,</hi> Ezek. 1. 19, 20. and <hi>chap.</hi> 10. 16, 17. ſo it is here, <hi>They both together, at the ſame inſtant, worſhip him that liveth for ever and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in this Chapter the Elders are firſt deſcribed, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. And though in order of words, the living creatures are firſt mentioned in this place (though that proves not they are firſt in work); it may be to inſtruct us, that whenever the Church on Earth bows before him that ſits on the Throne; thoſe that are preſent with the Lord, joyn there with in their adoration alſo.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The living creatures may in this place be mentioned in order of words before the Elders; becauſe the Apoſtle had from <hi>ver.</hi> 6. been deſcribing and ſpeaking of them; and ſo he would finiſh what he had to ſay of them, before he would again ſpeak of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                  <p>But we ſhall come to look into this Verſe a little particularly, in which we ſhall ſpeak unto the Act, or Acts of their worſhip, as they are here declared to us; for as to the object of it, it is the very ſame, and in the ſame words deſcribed, with the object of the worſhip of the four living creatures. To which we have ſpoken already in the foregoing Verſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The four and twenty Elders fall down and worſhip].</hi> Theſe two phraſes may ſignifie to us one and the ſame thing: theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions here may both ſignifie the Worſhip and Reverence they give, (compare <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 8. with <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 6. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 9. with <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 7.) as the object is one and the ſame object, though deſcribed to us in two branches, <hi>[Him that ſate on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever],</hi> and both of them are joyned together in <hi>ver.</hi> 9. Or, we may ſay,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They fall down],</hi> that is, they do moſt ſubmiſſively proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the great King of Heaven and Earth, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 14. they fall down from their ſeats or thrones, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and <hi>chap.</hi> 11. 16. and <hi>chap.</hi> 19. 4. ſignifying, he is infinitely above them, and his throne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. theirs</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="631" facs="tcp:48916:303"/>
                     <hi>And worſhip],</hi> to wit, adore, or religiouſly reverence him, <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 46. 6.) <hi>and caſt their crowns before the throne],</hi> that is, when they worſhip, they lay a ſide their ornaments of glory, and make themſelves like or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary perſons, as it were, like their brethren that are on earth; they make themſelves as common perſons, as it were; as their crowns may be ſaid to be profaned (and themſelves conſequently) when they are caſt to the ground, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 39. <hi>They ſit down from their head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires, and crowns of glory, in token of humility; as they are inſtructed to do,</hi> Jer. 13. 18. And thus they proſtrate themſelves, not before an Image, Idol, or fellow-creature, as Idolaters in former times, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his profeſſed people, and amongſt the Heathen alſo did, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 15-20. and <hi>chap.</hi> 46. 10. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 5, 7, 10, 15. and as too many in our days do, but before him that liveth for ever and ever: And their humble proſtration of themſelves before him that ſits on the throne, may thus be declared to us that are here below.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To preſerve us from making any Saints departed, though never ſo excellent and glorious, the objects of our religious adoration; or from invocating, or praying to them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. and <hi>chap.</hi> 22. 8, 9. they do, as it were, by their acts of deep humility, in falling down, worſhipping, and caſting their crowns before the throne, actually ſay, <hi>We are not worthy to receive religious worſhip; but thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour, &amp;c.</hi> Verſ. 11. They by removing their Diadems, and taking off, and caſting down their crowns, do, as it were, ſay, <hi>We are not the He, whoſe right it is to be worſhipped,</hi> (as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. 26, 27.) but that appertains only to him that ſits on the Throne; and indeed He, and He only is to be religiouſly worſhipped and ſerved by us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the very humble adoration, and proſtration of thoſe that dwell in Heaven, which is more fully and ſignificantly expreſſed, and plainly declared to us here, than that of the four living creatures; we may learn, That the neerer we are to, and the more clearly we behold him that ſits on the throne, his glorious Holineſs, Almightineſs, and Majeſty; the more it will fill us with low thoughts of our ſelves, and cauſe us to defile our Horn in the duſt. This here appears by the account given us of the exerciſe of the living creatures, and of that of the Elders. Of the former indeed it may be intimated to us, that they do humble themſelves in the preſence of the Lord; and in token thereof, with <hi>two of their wings may cover their faces;</hi> as we have ſaid before in the notes on <hi>ver.</hi> 8. but of the latter it is ſaid, <hi>They fall down before him that ſate on the throne, and worſhip him—and</hi>
                     <pb n="632" facs="tcp:48916:304"/>
                     <hi>caſt their crowns before the throne;</hi> ſo alſo in <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 14. of the living creatures it is only ſaid, <hi>they ſaid Amen.</hi> To which is preſently added, <hi>And the twenty four elders fell down, and worſhipped him that liveth for ever and ever.</hi> And in <hi>chap.</hi> 11. 16. where the Elders are only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, it is ſaid of them, <hi>They fell on their faces and worſhipped God.</hi> (Indeed, where the Elders and living creatures are joyntly ſpoken of in their worſhip, the ſame acts or exerciſes are affirmed of both, as <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 8. and <hi>chap.</hi> 19. 4. but not ſo when they, and the acts of their worſhip are diſtinctly mentioned). The truth hereof we might alſo ſee in the holy and glorious Angels; it is ſaid of them, <hi>Yea of all of them, they fell before the throne on their faces, and worſhipped God,</hi> Chap. 7. 11. ſee alſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 11-23. [ſee the notes before on <hi>ver.</hi> 8.] As alſo this may be ſeen in thoſe holy Ones who are on earth in mortal bodies; that the clearer ſight and viſion they have of him that ſits on the throne, and the neerer, as it were, they are to him, the more their own imperfection, ſhortneſs, and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in themſelves appears; ſo as pride is hidden from them, and they even loath themſelves. Thus it was with the holy man <hi>Job;</hi> when he only heard of God by the hearing of the ear, he carried it too highly, and ſometimes ſpake unadviſedly; as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith unto him, <hi>Thou ſaidſt my righteouſneſs is more than Gods,</hi> Job 35. 2. But when he had a more open ſight of the Almighty, he crys out, <hi>Behold I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth: once have I ſpoken, but I will not anſwer; yea twice, but I will proceed no further,</hi> Job 40. 3, 4, 5. with <hi>chap.</hi> 13. 18, 22. and <hi>chap.</hi> 23. 2, 5. And again he thus ſaith and confeſſeth, <hi>I have uttered that I underſtood not, things too wonderful for me, which I knew not—I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee: wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes,</hi> Chap. 42. 3, 5, 6. Thus alſo it was with the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> when he had that viſion vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to him, <hi>In which he ſaw the Lord ſitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple: above it ſtood the Seraphims—and one cried unto another, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hoſts;</hi> then, ſaid he, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone, I am cut off, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. ſee alſo <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 5-8-15-17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 13-17. and without doubt, thoſe which are in their ſpirits in Heaven, and being abſent from the body, are preſent with the Lord, they are more humble than we are, who are on earth. And did we more clearly behold his glory, and glorious Majeſty who ſits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the throne, as it is diſcovered to us in the face of Chriſt in the
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:48916:304"/>
Goſpel? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4-6. It would cauſe us to lye low before him, and hide us in the duſt, for the glory of his Majeſty; and yet, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of his grace, come, by our High-prieſt, with boldneſs to the throne of grace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 14, 16. And that any of us are proud, and highly conceited of our ſelves, and are lifting up our ſelves unduly in language, apparel, or demeanour of our ſelves, is becauſe of our fooliſhneſs and ignorance of God; or becauſe we do not behold in the glaſs of the Goſpel, the glory of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. the proud perſon is a fool, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 1-6. with <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 5. Oh then! humble we our ſelves in the ſight of the Lord, and he will lift us up, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 5-7-10. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 19. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28, 29. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 2-4.</p>

that he is a moſt perfect hater of ſin, and never created men to ſin, nor doth he preſerve them here to this end.</p>
                  <p>This was not, nor is his will and pleaſure for which they are, and were created<hi>: Chriſt came into the world to do the will of him that ſent him, and it was his meat and drink to do it,</hi> John 4. 34. and <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 30. and <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 38.

                  <p>And therefore he never willed any of his creatures to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal deſtruction, but for ſin, which was not his pleaſure, or will they ſhould commit, as we have before ſhewed.

                  <p>And when they had thus ſinned, and God might righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly have caſt them off, and deſtroyed them for ever;
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:48916:310"/>
yet then God manifeſted he had no pleaſure in the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtruction of any of mankind, in that he deviſed ſuch a bleſſed device, that his baniſhed ſhould not be expelled from him: He ſo loved the world of mankind, that he gave his Son by his grace to taſte death for every man, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16, 17. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 9. and raiſed him from the dead for their juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25. with <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 23, 24.

So as no man ſhall periſh for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in that firſt death, but all ſhall be raiſed out of it by the man Jeſus Chriſt, who is become the reſurrection and the life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 21, 22. And when raiſed, no man ſhall be caſt into the ſecond death for that firſt ſin and ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſimply; but for loving darkneſs rather than light, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter light was vouchſafed to them: <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall dye,</hi> Jer. 31. 29, 30. Ezek. 18. 1, 2, 4.</p>

                  <p>WE have in the former Chapter ſeen, and according to my great weakneſs, conſidered the Account which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> gives of the Heavenly Theatre; in which is deſcribed to us the Imperial Seſſion of him that ſate and ſits for ever upon the Throne, or ſupream Seat of Government, whoſe Kingdom Ruleth over all Perſons and Things in Heaven and in Earth, and under the Earth, and whoſe Dominion is an everlaſting Dominion; and the Four and twenty Elders, and the Four Living Creatures, as the Repreſentatives of the Church of the Living God in Heaven and in Earth, in a general Conſideration the whole Family of Chriſt.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>There is mention made of ſeveral Books in this <hi>Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> All the things which Jeſus Chriſt by his Angels ſent and ſignified unto the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> he was commanded to Write
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:48916:313"/>
in a Book, and ſend it unto the Seven Churches in <hi>Aſia, Chap.</hi> 1. 2. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. 7, 9, 10, 18, 19. So alſo herein there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of the Book of Life, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 5. and 20. 12, 15. And of the Lambs Book of Life, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 8. and 17. 8. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. 27. And of other Books diſtinct from the Books of Life, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. 12.</p>
                  <p>But there are two Books ſpoken of and mentioned in this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> which may moſt fully and properly be called <hi>Books of Prophecy;</hi> the one whereof is that here mentioned, and the other is ſpoken of in <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 2, 8, 9, 10. And the Sum or Contents of theſe two Books is declared to us in this Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> from this place to the end of it.</p>
                  <p>Now then it doth evidently appear that this Book, ſpoken of in this place, is not the Word of the beginning of Chriſt, for that was not then Sealed, but it had been before that time o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by the Holy Apoſtles; they had Preached the Goſpel, according to the Revelation of the Myſtery, before this time, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25, 26. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 9. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 25, 26. And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> particularly had born record of the Word of God, and of the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, before the things contained in this Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> were ſent and ſignified to him. <hi>[See the notes before on Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>and v.</hi> 2.]</p>
                  <p>But this Book here mentioned doth in general contain in it the Mind, Counſels and Purpoſes of God concerning future Things, Actions and Events, which ſhould come to paſs from, and after that time unto, the end of this World, with the order of their fulfilling and accompliſhment; and ſomething of the World to come. What the Contents of this Book are, is, I conceive in general declared to us by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>viz. Chap.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>[Things which muſt be hereafter]</hi> as alſo plainly appears in the opening of the Seven Seals, under the Seventh whereof the Seven Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſound; and when the laſt of the Seven ſounded, then great voices in Heaven ſay, <hi>The Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall Reign for ever and ever,</hi> chap. 6. and chap. 8. 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 12: and chap. 9. 1, 13. and chap. 11. 15, 18. This Book then is a Book of his Mind, Counſels and Purpoſes, who ſits upon the Supream Throne of Judgment, concerning the things that muſt come to paſs, or be hereafter, from that time, with the order of them—And this Book here ſpoken of is called,</p>

1. <hi>[A Book]</hi> ſimply, whereas that which is mentioned in <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 2, 8, 9, 10. is called <hi>[A little Book]</hi> and thereby it appears that this Book is more large and comprehenſive than that.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is ſaid to be <hi>[A Book ſealed with ſeven Seals]</hi> whereas that which is ſpoken of <hi>chap.</hi> 10. 2. Is <hi>[An open Book]</hi> To which afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Now ſome (as Dr. <hi>H.</hi> Dr. <hi>L.)</hi> look upon this Book, as containing Gods Secret Counſels, Purpoſes and Decrees, concerning <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Jewiſh Nation directly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>and upon the matter wholly, with the Judgments to be executed thereupon, and the Deſtruction thereof. Their great miſtake wherein appears<hi>:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. By what We have formerly ſaid and ſhewn, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was deſtroyed before the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> had theſe Viſions, or the Contents of this Book in general ſent and ſignified to him; for the Martyr <hi>Antipas</hi> was ſlain (as is acknowledged ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally) after the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and yet before <hi>John</hi> received theſe Viſions and Revelations from the Lord. <hi>[See the Notes before on chap.</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 13.]</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                     </gap>ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewed unto them one evident Sign that ſhould immediately come to paſs; and whereby they might know the Deſolation thereof was nigh; <hi>viz. When,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ye ſhall ſee</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>compaſſed with Armies, then know that the Deſolation thereof is nigh: Then let them which are in</hi> Judea <hi>flee to the Mountains,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 1, 29. <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 1, 26. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 5, 21, &amp;c. And now if this Book we are now ſpeaking of, did contain the ſame buſineſs, it could not properly be called, <hi>A ſealed Book;</hi> becauſe in a great meaſure it was opened before by our Lord Jeſus to the Apoſtles in general, and alſo to the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> particularly<hi>: Mark</hi> 13. 3. Seeing alſo our Lord, as I conceive,
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:48916:314"/>
had ſpoken more plainly there of the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Signs thereof, than can be ſuppoſed he doth here; as may appear by conſidering and comparing the three Evangeliſts fore-referred to: But now this Book is ſtill a ſealed Book; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of Jeſus Chriſt; and after his pouring forth the Holy Spirit upon his Apoſtles. Therefore this Book refers principally unto ſome other Matter and Place.</p>

And it ſtill and farther appears, that this Book doth not directly, much leſs onely contain the Mind and Purpoſes of God concerning the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe of that ſaid to the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> when he had taken and eaten up the little Book, <hi>viz. Thou muſt Prophecy again before or againſt</hi> (as the Word is tranſlated, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 2.) <hi>many Peoples, and Nations, and Tongues, and Kings, chap.</hi> 10. 10, 11. Implying that his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Prophecy was not againſt or concerning <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Jewiſh Nation onely nor directly; but againſt many Peoples, and Nations, and Tongues, and Kings; the word <hi>[many]</hi> though in the laſt place, may indifferently agree to all, there being not ſo much as a Comma between the ſeveral words. Now that former Prophecy of his, there intimately pointed to, is contained in this Book, under preſent conſideration. Indeed the judgments contained in this ſealed Book might fall heavy upon ſome, and many particular Jews; but not upon <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> it ſelf, or that Nation; for that, and it, were judged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as hath been often ſaid, and in a good meaſure, as I conceive, proved.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> as directed by the Holy Ghoſt, had fore-written fully of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Jewiſh Nation, in his Prophecy; whereto our Saviour refers in ſpeaking of the Signs that preceded the Deſtruction of that City, <hi>&amp;c. Matth.</hi> 24. 15, 21. And this eſpecially reſpects the Gentiles, and not at all the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as is before ſaid.</p>
                  <p>And ſo we may ſay, This Book contains in it, as I conceive, the Mind of God and his Counſels and Purpoſes, concerning this World in general, or the Roman Empire, which was then over the whole World<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As the little Book, <hi>chap.</hi> 10. reſpects the Church eſpecially<hi>:</hi> And therefore this former is called, <hi>A Book,</hi> the latter, <hi>A little Book,</hi> as being leſs than this, and not ſo comprehenſive and large; as is before noted. And ſo
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:48916:314"/>
we ſhall look upon and ſpeak unto this former Book in this <hi>chap.</hi> 5. in what follows, as containing Gods Mind, Counſels and Purpoſes, concerning the Roman Empire, which was then greatly ſtretched forth, and very vaſt, large and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
                  <p>But now in that in this Book is fore-written things which muſt be hereafter; ſo we may learn from hence, That all things are naked and opened to the All-ſeeing Eyes of him with whom we have to do: In his Book, <hi>All things are written which in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance are faſhioned and fulfilled,</hi> Pſal. 139. 16. <hi>The things which muſt come to paſs are laid up in ſtore with him, and ſealed up among his treaſures,</hi> Deut. 32. 34. <hi>Behold it is written before me,</hi> ſaith the Lord, Iſa. 65. 6. <hi>[See the Notes before on</hi> chap. 4. verſe 1.]</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have next to enquire and conſider, Where did the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſee this Book? And that is <hi>[In the right hand of him that ſate on the Throne]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was in his hand that ſate upon the Throne, All is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before him before it be opened, or made known to us; or the contents thereof executed. And we may hereby ſee and underſtand his infinite fitneſs and meetneſs to govern, in that all things are written before him that ſits on the ſeat, the ſupream ſeat of judgement, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>The Lords Throne is in Heaven, his Eyes behold, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 11. 4, 5. Men that are upon the throne here below, cannot fore-ſee future things, and therefore cannot ſo govern, but that in ſome caſes, they may ſee good reaſon to wiſh they had done otherwiſe: Becauſe of their neſcience of things which after come to paſs, they may ſometimes erre and miſtake, or not do ſo well as otherwiſe they might have done<hi>:</hi> But he ſeeth and knoweth all things, <hi>Job</hi> 36. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And this Book was in the hand of him that ſate and ſits for ever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne:</hi> And ſo it may give us to underſtand, That this Book is ſuch an one as in which is contained his Government of, and over the world, as hath been formerly ſaid: It is in his hand as the ſupreme Governour. <hi>The little Book is in the hand of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Angel,</hi> whereby may be meant our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who in this Chapter is ſaid to be <hi>in the midſt of the Throne: And yet his right foot is upon the Sea, and his left foot upon the Earth;</hi> for God hath crowned him as the Son of Man and Head of the Church, with glory and honour, and ſet him over the works of his hands; and put all things in ſubjection under his feet: though yet we ſee not

                  <p n="1">1. His Almighty power, who ſits upon the Throne to perform all that is written therein, in his right hand of power, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 62. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 69. <hi>In his right hand,</hi> whereby he hath ſpanned the Heavens, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. 12, 13. <hi>and nothing is too hard for him, Jer.</hi> 32. 17. 27. In his right hand, whereby he hath formerly conquered enemies; as it is ſaid, <hi>Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power; thy right hand, O Lord, hath daſhed in pieces the enemy. Thou ſtretchedſt out thy right hand, the earth ſwallowed them, Exod.</hi> 15. 6. 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98. 1. which hand is called his mighty hand, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 15. and <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 8, 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with which he ſtrengthened the Captain of our ſalvation, ſo as the enemy did not exact upon him. But though the Devil and his Inſtruments thruſt ſore at him, that he might fall, yet the Lord helped him. <hi>The right hand of the Lord did valiantly, the right hand of the Lord was exalted,</hi> Pſal. 118. 11-13-16. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 19-22. And with this right hand he will ſubdue and conquer ſtill all his enemies. <hi>His right hand ſhall find out thoſe that hate him,</hi> Pſal. 21. 8-11. And yet with this right hand, in which this Book is, he will ſave all them from evil who hearken unto and put their truſt in him; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 6. and <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 10.

                  <p n="3">3. What he ſaw of, or concerning this Book: And that is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Somewhat of the writing of it <hi>[It was written within and on the back-ſide.]</hi> that is, It was written within and without. As <hi>[Back-ſide]</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>[within]</hi> And as it is in a Roll when rolled up, The inmoſt part is that within, and the other that on the back-ſide: for ſo their Books were formerly in Rolls rolled up together; whereto reſpect is had, when it is ſaid, <hi>The Heaven departed as a Book or Scroll, when it is rolled together,</hi> Rev. 6. 14. And many times in <hi>Jer.</hi> 36. The ſame thing is ſometimes called the Roll of a Book, ſometimes a Book; as may be ſeen in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring verſe 2, 4, 6. with verſe 8. 10, 11, 13. and verſe 14. with verſe 18. and verſe 23, 27, 28, 29. with verſe 32. See <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 1. And in that this Book or Roll is ſaid to be written within, and on the back-ſide, or without: So we may thereby underſtand that it was perfected and filled up: It was ordinary to write but on the fore-ſide or within<hi>:</hi> But this Book was fully written or filled up with Writing on both ſides; yet ſo as to to leave room or place for the Seals. His work herein, and in all things is perfect, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 4. And ſo it was like unto that Roll given to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Of which it is ſaid, <hi>When I looked, behold an Hand was ſent unto me, and lo, a Roll of a Book was therein; and he ſpread it before me, and it was written within and without; and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and wo,</hi> Ezek. 2. 8, 9, 10. And in that it is ſaid to be written perfectly, while it was in the right hand of him that ſate on the Throne, and before it was taken out: So we may learn, that what was written in the Volume or Roll of this Book, was not of Mans Writing, but the Writing was the Writing of God, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 16. It was Written with the Finger of God, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 18. To wit, with the Holy Spirit; compare <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 20. with <hi>Matth.</hi>
                     <pb n="744" facs="tcp:48916:316"/>
12. 28. And ſo it was very excellent, and all in it true, no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake or error therein; for the Spirit is the Spirit of Truth, yea the Truth, <hi>John</hi> 15. 26. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He alſo declares to us ſomewhat of the Sealing of this Book: It was <hi>[Sealed with ſeven Seals]</hi> that is to ſay, it was moſt perfectly ſealed: As the word <hi>[ſeven]</hi> is a number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and ſo oft uſed in this Book, and in many other places. <hi>[See the Notes after on verſe</hi> 6. <hi>of this Chapter.]</hi> And we may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the Seals were altogether in one place, at the opening of this Book or Roll; but in ſeven ſeveral places. For if all had been together at the top or opening of it, all muſt have been loſed or opened at once; and before any part of the Roll or Book could be lookt into or read; but ſo it was not ſealed, but the ſeven Seals were in ſeven places, and opened one after another; as it is ſaid, The Lamb opened one or the firſt of the Seals: and he opened afterward the ſecond Seal, and after that the third, <hi>&amp;c. chap.</hi> 6. 1, 3, 5, 7. 9, 12. and <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 1. So as at the opening of every one of the ſeven Seals in order, the Roll or Book is farther opened, and ſome new matter appears, and is diſcovered; as may be ſeen, in <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 1. 3. 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this Book or Roll, may be ſaid to be <hi>[ſealed.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. As ſealing ſignifies authorizing a thing, and making it valid and authentick, or giving power or force thereto: So the Letters or Decrees of Kings were ſealed; and ſo ratified, eſtabliſhed, and authorized. So <hi>Jezebel</hi> wrote Letters in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s name and ſealed them with his Seal, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 8. And the Letters which <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> gave <hi>Haman</hi> authority to write in his name, were ſealed with the Kings Ring, <hi>Eſth.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. This Book was <hi>[ſealed with ſeven Seals]</hi> that is, compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, made an end of, and finiſhed, ſo as no more was to be added to it: As it is with a Letter when it is ſealed up, then there is no more to be put into it. And as it is ſaid to the ſame purpoſe, Bind up the Teſtimony, ſeal the Law among my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 16. And whoſoever ſhall add unto the things
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:48916:316"/>
                     <hi>therein contained, God will add unto him the Plagues that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this Book: And if any man ſhall take away from the words of the Book of this Prophecy, God ſhall take away his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the Holy City, and from the things which are written in this Book,</hi> chap. 22. 18, 19.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Book is <hi>[ſealed with ſeven Seals]</hi> and ſo ſecured from danger: As thoſe Perſons whom he would preſerve from evil, had a mark ſet upon them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 4, 6. Or were ſealed for ſafety and preſervation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 3, 8. and <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 4. So this Book had the Seals or Seal of the Living God upon it; as <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 2. So as it ſhall not be deſtroyed or conſumed, as that Roll or Book was ſpoken of in <hi>Jer.</hi> 36. 2. 23. But he will preſerve it from this generation for ever<hi>:</hi> And ſo much alſo is implied in what is ſaid of it before, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is in the right hand of him that ſits upon the Throne, and ſo out of the reach of all evil, danger and enemie whatſoever: none is able to pluck it out of the right hand of the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for he is infinitely greater than all Creatures whatever; as <hi>John</hi> 10. 27,-29, 30.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And moſt eſpecially and directly this Book is ſaid to be <hi>[ſealed with ſeven ſeals]</hi> to give us to underſtand that it is ſhut up, hidden and ſecret; ſo that if it had been delivered to one that is learned, ſaying, <hi>Read this,</hi> he would anſwer, I cannot, for it is ſealed; as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 11, 12. So it is ſaid to <hi>Daniel, But thou, O</hi> Daniel, <hi>ſhut up the words and ſeal the Book, even to the time of the end:</hi> And again, <hi>Go thy way</hi> Daniel, <hi>for the words are cloſed up and ſealed till the time of the end,</hi> Dan. 12. 4, 8, 9. And as the voice from Heaven ſaid to the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> when he was about to write; <hi>Seal up thoſe things which the ſeven thunders uttered, and write them not,</hi> Rev. 10. 4. So we are here to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it principally, This Book was ſhut or cloſed up, ſo as no meer Creature was able to open it or to read it, or look thereon or therein; as it follows, <hi>verſe</hi> 2, 3, 4.

                  <p>It was an Angel that he ſaw, which words denote not the nature of this Perſon, but his Office; though very likely he was one of thoſe glorious Creatures, which are moſt frequently ſo called: yet as to their nature they are Spirits, ſuch as have not Fleſh, and Bones as Men have, though ſometimes they have appeared like Men.

Which ſignifies all the Holy Angels are mighty and powerful; but yet it ſeems ſome of them do excel others in ſtrength and power; as ſome of them do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel others in dignity: and as there are ſome called Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, ſo ſome are called Powers, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 22.

But how ſtrong or mighty ſoever they or any of them are, yet he that ſits upon the Throne is higher than the higheſt of them, and mightier than the ſtrongeſt of them; for he is the Lord God Almighty, that can do every thing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 8.

That is to ſay, Who of all created beings is worthy to undertake and perform this great work? It is an univerſal challenge to all meer Creatures in Heaven and in Earth, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Earth; as appears verſe 3.

                  <p n="2">2. We have next in order to conſider, what the Elder ſaid unto the Apoſtle, to comfort him; and that is propounded to us,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By what he ſaid unto the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> as with reſpect unto himſelf:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[Weep not:]</hi> Wherein we have ſignified to us<hi>:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That there was ſomewhat of Infirmity in the Apoſtles weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lamentation, as hath been before noted, or elſe the Elder would not thus have forbidden him to weep. In ſome caſes and upon ſome occaſions they may weep and mourn: As the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy into heavineſs,</hi> Jam. 4. 9. But at ſometimes they may cauſleſly or unſeaſonably lament: So <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, &amp;c.</hi> ſaid unto all the people, <hi>This day is holy unto the LORD, mourn not, nor weep, neither be ye ſorry; for all the people wept,</hi> Neh. 8. 9, 10, 11, 12.

And here it ſeems this excellent Apoſtle did in a great meaſure, weep cauſleſly, or not upon a good ground.

                  <p n="2">2. But yet we may ſee the Lord is very pitiful, and of very tender mercies; and therefore though the Apoſtle did weep in a great meaſure cauſleſly, yet he ſends a Meſſenger to ſpeak good words, and comfortable words to him, to ſay unto him, <hi>Weep not;</hi> and to inform him of, or to put to his remembrance what might comfort him, and wipe away his tears, or deliver him from his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: He is not like unto us who are evil, if we ſee another mourn cauſleſly, we are ready to ſhut up the bowels of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. In that the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> doth record this matter, <hi>viz.</hi> his weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the cauſe thereof; and the Elders Prohibition, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Weep not;</hi> in which appears ſomewhat of the Apoſtles infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and how he was repreſſed, and ſomewhat reproved for it; ſo we may learn, that he did not only record ſuch things as in which he was lifted up, but ſuch things alſo as in which his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties appeared, and which might caſt ſhame upon him. Thus alſo he tells us, how he fell at the feet of the Angel to worſhip him, which he ought not to have done, and how he was blamed for it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. and <hi>Chapt.</hi> 22. 8, 9. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 17, 18. Thus other holy Ones have done: <hi>My feet were almoſt gone,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>my ſteps had well nighſlipt—Thus was mine heart grieved, and I was pricked in my reins; ſo fooliſh was I and ignorant, I was as a beaſt before thee—my Soul refuſed to be comforted: And I ſaid, this is my infirmity,</hi> Pſal. 73. and 77. and 34 Title. And very frequently when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> declares the exceeding abundant Grace of to

How loath to turn at reproof, or to acknowledge how we have been faulted and blamed by ſuch as are faithful in the Lord!

                  <p n="2">2.

Whatever he hath ſpoken or promiſed by any meſſenger, is, or ſhall be accompliſhed in due time, and according to the tenor thereof, his faithfulneſs may be clearly and comfortably ſeen, in that he hath raiſed up an Horn of Salvation for us, in the Houſe of his Servant <hi>David:</hi> As he ſpake by the mouth of his Holy Prophets, which have been ſince the World began, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 55, 56, 68-70-75.

Whatſoever Meſſenger he ſends with his Word, <hi>bleſſed is he that believeth, for there ſhall be a performance of thoſe things that are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> Luk. 1. 45. And God is many times greatly diſpleaſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with ſuch as have not believed his words brought by his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, becauſe of the appearing improbability or difficulty of the accompliſhment of what was ſo ſpoken: See 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 1, 2, 19, 20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 19 21. So <hi>Zacharias</hi> was ſtricken dumb, <hi>and was not able to ſpeak for a ſeaſon, becauſe he believed not the Angels words,</hi> Luke 13. 20.

The Lamb that had been ſlain, and who ſtands as ſuch an one in the midſt of the Throne<hi>:</hi> And it is upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Sufferings, Sacrifice, and Mediation, that he hath thus prevailed; therefore doth his Father love him, and ſo loves him, that he hath given all things into his hand, becauſe he laid down his life, that he might take it up again; and therefore he ſhews all things to him that himſelf doth, <hi>John</hi> 10. 17, 18. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 35, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 20. His blood is ſo precious with his Father, that it hath wonderfully proſpered with him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 4. with <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6-8, 9, 10.

In that he came and took the Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo we may ſee his Intereſt in, and freeneſs and familiarity (if I may ſo ſpeak) with him that ſits on the Throne, and that he will deny him nothing, nor with-hold any thing from him, <hi>John</hi> 11. 22, 41, 42. He was greatly miſtaken, who ſaid to <hi>Bathſheba, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the King, for he will not ſay thee nay,</hi> 1 King. 2. 17-23. But God hath taken up ſuch infinite well-pleaſedneſs in his Son, <hi>that he will never turn away his face,</hi> Prov. 8. 30, 31. <hi>Ask of me, ſaith God</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion,</hi> Pſal. 2. 6, 7, 8.

Then it was ſo far off, as it were from all creatures, that none durſt preſume to come near to him in order to the opening of it, and therefore the Apoſtle wept much: But now the four living creatures, and four and twenty Elders rejoycingly worſhip, becauſe their kinſman, their friend, their Mediator had it. So we may ſay more generally; this is matter and cauſe of joy and gladneſs to us, not ſimply, that all fulneſs is in God, or in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature; But that all is now, by means of his pretious blood, put into the hands of Chriſt, that in him it hath pleaſed all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to dwell, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18, 19. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 9, 10. for of his fulneſs we may receive, and grace for grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14, 16.

                  </p>
                  <p>That is to ſay, hereby is ſignified to us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

And this geſture was alſo uſed in the worſhip of the true object of worſhip: As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>I fell down before the Lord;</hi> and again, <hi>Thus I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the firſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. 18, 25. <hi>And the four and twenty Elders fell down, and worſhipped him that liveth for ever and ever, Rev.</hi> 5. 14. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. 4. And ſo we are here to underſtand it: They fell down and worſhipped the Lamb, or they fell down to worſhip before the Lamb, <hi>viz.</hi> with a divine and religious worſhip, as will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the later end of this verſe<hi>:</hi> And ſo we may learn from hence, that not only the Saints on earth, but the holy Ones in Heaven alſo are ſtill worſhippers, and give Divine Adoration to the true object of worſhip; as we have ſeen before: [ſee the notes on <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10.] And poſſibly, the four living creatures are here firſt named in this Adoration, becauſe the greater, or firſt part of the things contained in the ſealed Book, were to be tranſacted on earth: And ſo in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 1, 8. the four living creatures are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned alone without the Elders: As on ſome what a like account, the twenty four Elders are mentioned alone, when the voices were heard in Heaven, and the Kingdoms of this world became Chriſts, <hi>Rev.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. As to the effecting the former, there was nothing required of men, but it was done for them without them, in and by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15 19.

4. The firſt was effected by a price given to God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>He gave himſelf for us an offering and a ſacrifice unto God for a ſweet-ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſavour,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 2.

But to this alſo we may ſpeak further.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thoſe who are only redeemed, or bought in the firſt ſenſe, are and remain but the ſubjects of the love of pity and compaſſionate kindneſs and benevolence, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 4.

                  <p>And the not diſtinguiſhing between theſe two, that effected in Chriſt, and that which he is effecting in men, and doth effect in them that believe, is the reaſon and cauſe of ſo great miſtake and confuſion in mens underſtandings about, and expreſſings of theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By what means did he redeem them? <hi>By thy blood.</hi> And ſo,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not by keeping the Law, or by his doing what is contained therein, and commanded thereby; though yet he always did thoſe things which pleaſed his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 28, 29. and 4. 34. <hi>But if righteouſneſs could have come by the law,</hi> (even by his keeping of it) <hi>then Chriſt died in vain,</hi> Gal. 2. 21. He had without doubt fully and perfectly kept the Law, when he cried out thrice, <hi>O my Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 39, 42, 44. And thus he cried out, not becauſe he was unwilling to drink it, for he did delight to do the will of his God, yea his Law was in the midſt of his heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 6, 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5, 8. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 11. But for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to us, even to ſhew unto us, that though he loved righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and never tranſgreſſed at any time his Fathers commandment; yet that notwithſtanding, or any thing elſe, the cup could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly paſs from Chriſt, but he muſt drink it, or we muſt have drank it, and periſhed by it: <hi>Without ſhedding of blood there was no remiſſion, Heb.</hi> 9. 22. and therefore Chriſt muſt needs have ſuffered, that he might redeem and buy us of God, and that he might redeem us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 2, 3. <hi>What the law could not do, in that it was weak thorow the fleſh, God ſent his own ſon in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8. 2, 3 32.

And the preaching of the Croſs, of the weakneſs of Chriſt, and God, is the power of God, for redeeming us unto himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17, 18-23-25.

                  <p>2. We come now to note ſome Inſtructions from hence; as to ſay,</p>
                  <p>1. That theſe Saints and holy ones were ſometimes of the kindreds and tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were ſometimes of the world: this is implied, in that it is here acknowledged by them with thankfulneſs to the Lamb, <hi>Thou haſt redeemed us out of every kindred, &amp;c:</hi> they were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen now out of the world; but that ſignifies they were ſometimes of it, as <hi>John</hi> 15. 19. and <hi>chap.</hi> 17. 6. And as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of both believing <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they were in former times dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and were by nature children of wrath, even as others, as bad as the worſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1-4. they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times darkneſs, and under the power of Satan; and ſo in the ſtate, condition, and fellowſhip of this world, <hi>John</hi> 5. 24. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. And the ſame may be ſaid of the Saints now living, that ſometimes they were not a people, not an elect, or redeemed people;
<pb n="838" facs="tcp:48916:363"/>
as he ſaith both with reſpect to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved that was not beloved,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 23, 24, 26. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>And the conſideration hereof may be uſeful to the now living re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To hide pride from them, and keep them low in themſelves, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring what manner of perſons they themſelves ſometimes were, even in as ſad a condition as others of the world now are, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 9, 11. As the Apoſtle ſaith to ſome, <hi>If thou being a wild olive-tree, wert graffed in amongſt them, and with them partakeſt of the root and fatneſs of the olive-tree: Boaſt not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17, 18. So God minds <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> of her former mean, and miſerable condition, to take her down, and to hide pride from her, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 1-7-16-22.

                  <p>2. And it may lead them, who have received mercy, to be pitiful, meek, and gentle towards others that are ſtill of the world. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> thus chargeth <hi>Titus, Put them in mind—to be gentle, ſhewing all meekneſs to all men; for we our ſelves alſo were ſometimes fooliſh, diſobedient, deceived, ſerving divers luſts and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another,</hi> Tit. 3. 2, 3.

As we may alſo ſhew under the laſt particular here propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. So it is in this place ſaid, not only by the four living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to wit, that part of the Church of Chriſt on earth, [ſee notes on <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 6.] but alſo by the four and twenty Elders, the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, as we have ſhewed, [ſee notes on <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 4.] <hi>We ſhall reign, &amp;c.</hi> And if by the twenty four
<pb n="852" facs="tcp:48916:370"/>
Elders we are to underſtand, the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, as I make no doubt of it at all, then the conſideration of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that ſhall ſo reign, doth undeniably evince and demonſtrate, that all the Saints, not only the ſurviving of Chriſts body, but ſuch alſo as have fallen aſleep in Chriſt, ſhall be the ſubjects of this Kingdom on earth, and ſhall reign thereon in due ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Indeed a learned man (Dr. <hi>H.)</hi> from this very Scripture we are ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to, concludes, that by the four and twenty Elders alſo are meant ſuch as were then in mortal bodies, and ſo alive in this world, becauſe it is ſaid by them alſo, <hi>We ſhall reign on the earth.</hi> To which I ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hereby he gives us to underſtand that had it not been for this place only, or mainly, he had otherwiſe thought of them, and might have concluded, as ſurely he ſhould have done, that by the Elders are meant the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect. He was as it appears in a ſtrait between two, and what to conclude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Elders he wot not; but now this place, or rather his perverting and miſunderſtanding of it, cauſed him thus to ſpeak. [By this it is evident, that the Saints here are the Chriſtian people upon earth, and not the Saints which reign in Heaven.]</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But how comes he to conclude ſo from hence? Thus, firſt, He with the Church (as he calls it) concludes, that the Reign of Chriſt and his Saints upon the earth a thouſand years gloriouſly is an Hereſie, and thoſe that believe and teach it are Hereticks; and then it is no marvel that he ſhould endeavour, though weakly and ſlenderly enough, to pervert and corrupt the Scriptures ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hereof, and to conclude right or wrong, that the Saints here ſpoken of, and all of them were ſuch as then were alive in mortal bodies: The vanity and falſeneſs whereof, and his miſtakes therein, we have I conceive in ſome good meaſure detected and diſcovered, and ſhall have further occaſion ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>Yea that thoſe that have fallen aſleep in Chriſt, and ſo are not in mortal bodies, ſhall reign on the earth, appears evidently by other Scriptures alſo; ſo our Lord ſaith, <hi>He that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end,</hi> (of his life doubtleſs) <hi>to him will I give power over the nations, &amp;c.</hi> He will give him ſuch power after he hath kept Chriſts works unto the end, and future thereto, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 26, 27. with <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 23. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. 13.

is there alſo aſſured and promiſed as future and conſequential to overcoming: <hi>After they have done the will of God they ſhall inherit the promiſes,</hi> Heb. 10. 36, 37. (ſee the notes before on <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21.) Thus again the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſaw</hi> (to wit, in viſion) <hi>the ſouls of them that were beheaded,</hi> (actually ſlain and put to death) <hi>for the witneſs of Jeſus, and for the word of God; and</hi> (not them only, but them alſo) <hi>which had no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What can be ſpoken more plainly to this purpoſe to ſhew unto us, that ſuch as are now dead unto us, though they live unto God, ſhall then reign, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here again, that oft referred unto learned man, Dr. <hi>H.</hi> (though he rightly acknowledgeth and confeſſeth, that they that were behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were ſuch as actually laid down, and parted with their lives for Chriſt, yet) tells us, that what follows is not affirmed, or to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of thoſe individual perſons that were ſo beheaded, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a ſucceſſion of ſuch as they were. But in anſwer to that we may ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ſpeaks without book, in ſo ſaying; for them that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, appear evidently, and without controverſie, to be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that which is after affirmed, <hi>viz. they lived and reigned, &amp;c.</hi> Nor is there any intimation of any individual perſons to be there meant, but ſuch as were formerly beheaded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And truly, ſuch marring of the conſtruction of the words of the ſacred Scriptures by ſuch learned men, and perverting and wreſting the plain ſayings thereof, are of very dangerous conſequence, and render in vain and inſignificant the Pen of the holy Scribes, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 8, 9. and lead men to have their fear towards God, taught by their precepts and tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 11-14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whereas the ſaid Dr. tells us, that it is not ſaid, they that were beheaded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> revived, but only they lived; and therefore the ſame individual perſons that were beheaded, are not the ſubjects of that afterwards affirmed. I ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then if it had been ſaid, they that were beheaded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, he might have concluded, this Davidical reign was no Hereſie. And therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We further ſay thereto, and deſire it may be minded and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,</p>

1. That <hi>[lived]</hi> may be as much as, and the ſame with <hi>[revived]:</hi> Thus when the Widows ſon was dead, <hi>Elijah</hi> prayed, and ſaid, <hi>O Lord my God, I pray thee let this childs ſoul come into him again: And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah, and the ſoul of the child came into him, and he revived: And—Elijah ſaid unto his mother, See thy ſon liveth,</hi> to wit, <hi>reviveth,</hi> 1 King. 17. 17-23. ſee alſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 18. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 5. with <hi>John</hi> 10. 17. Nay,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We further ſay this in anſwer, that <hi>lived</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4, 5. ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, and muſt needs ſignifie <hi>revived;</hi> and that will appear, if we conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They lived by, and after a Reſurrection, as is there ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. So much is undeniably intimated in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 5. the reſt of the dead lived not again, or revived not, till the thouſand years were finiſhed; intimating to us plainly and evidently, that they that were beheaded, <hi>&amp;c. ver.</hi> 4. lived, to wit, lived again, or revived; but the reſt of the dead lived not again till after the thouſand years, which they alſo then did, even in the ſecond and general reſurrection, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 21, 22. <hi>John</hi> 5. 21.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And the ſeed of the righteous before ſpoken of, even all their children that were according to the Lords Ordinance and Inſtitution brought into the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or Church of Chriſt, whether by circumciſion, as formerly, or by baptiſm, as ſince the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and aſcenſion of Chriſt, and who dyed in infancy, or before they came to the uſe of underſtanding, ſhall reign on the Earth. Indeed for ſuch as whoſe circumciſion, or baptiſm, was careleſly or willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglected, when there was an opportunity, they are cut off from the congregation of the Lord; as it is ſaid, <hi>The uncircumciſed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, whoſe fleſh of his foreskin is not circumciſed, that ſoul ſhall be cut off from his people: he hath broken my covenant,</hi> Gen. 17. 14. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5. 5, 6.

                  <p>To this we ſhall give anſwer, and ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a <hi>reigning as kings,</hi> as is here plainly ſignified; <hi>thou haſt made us unto our God kings—and we ſhall reign,</hi> &amp;c. they ſhall have great authority, judgment, and government committed to them; when Chriſt as King ſhall reign in righteouſneſs, they as Princes ſhall rule in judgment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 1.

Then came the firſt, ſaying, <hi>Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds:</hi> and he ſaid unto him, <hi>Well, thou good ſervant—have thou authority over ten cities:</hi> and unto another he ſaid, <hi>Be thou alſo over five cities,</hi> Luke 19. 15, 17, 19, 27. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe alſo the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, ſaying, <hi>And I ſaw</hi> (to wit, in viſion) <hi>thrones</hi> (for theſe kings to ſit upon) <hi>and they ſate upon them, and judgment</hi> (to wit, rule and government, as the word frequently

And this will further appear alſo in what follows to be ſpoken unto by us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is ſuch a reigning alſo, as will be free from perſecution and trouble, from all moleſtation and diſquietment from enemies: they ſhall then delight themſelves in the abundance of peace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 7, 11.

For Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſhall then be bound, during the thouſand years of this glorious and peaceable reign, whoſe work it hath been, and will be until that time, to accuſe the brethren, and deceive the world, to diſquiet and perſecute the accuſed Saints: I ſay with the Scripture, <hi>He ſhall be bound, and caſt into the bottomleſs pit, and ſhut up, and a ſeal ſet upon him, that he ſhould deceive the nations no more, till the thouſand years ſhould be fulfilled,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 1, 3. with <hi>chap.</hi> 12. 9, 10. And then the oppreſſor ſhall be broken in pieces, indefinitely conſidered, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. 3, 4. <hi>The extortioner ſhall be at an end, the ſpoiler ceaſe, and the oppreſſors ſhall be conſumed out of the land,</hi> (or earth) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16. 4, 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 10, 11. Then indeed compleatly, God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor crying, <hi>&amp;c. Rev.</hi> 21. 1, 2, 4 The Sun ſhall no more light on them, nor any heat; and God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 16, 17.

ſoul and body till all things are made new, new Heavens, and a new Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is intimated in the place we are referring to, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17, 18. 23. ſo again he ſaith, it is a faithful ſaying, <hi>If we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign with him:</hi> where alſo their reigning is ſpoken of as future to their ſuffering, and both ſhall not be in the ſame time, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 11, 12. And indeed, if times of comparative tranquility may be called reigning-times; then theſe Saints, or, the Saints, might have ſaid, <hi>We have reigned:</hi> for it is ſaid in <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 31. then had the Churches reſt throughout all <hi>Judea, Galilee,</hi> and <hi>Samaria, &amp;c.</hi> But they ſpoke of it as future, we ſhall reign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea and then alſo, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> would not ſo ſharply and ſeverely have upbraided the <hi>Corinthians</hi> as he doth; for certainly they had great reſt, tranquility, and freedom from perſecution, and liberty for a quiet aſſembling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to worſhip God; And therefore, if Dr. <hi>H</hi>'s ſayings were true, they might laudably have ſaid, <hi>We do reign:</hi> But ſee how the Apoſtle checks and upbraids them for ſo thinking, notwithſtanding they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed Halcionian-days. <hi>Now ye are full,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Nor did the time of this reign begin in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time; as ſays (Dr. <hi>H.)</hi> for theſe who were now alive in mortal bodies, and who ſay, <hi>We ſhall reign,</hi> &amp;c. did not live until his Empire; nor did all the Saints in his days ſit upon thrones, and reign as kings; but generally they remained ſubjects, and the moſt of them poor ones alſo: nor were all the Saints, during his reign, or under the Empire of the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Emperours, wholly free from all perſecution and moleſtation from their enemies, as they ſhall aſſuredly be when they ſhall reign as kings, in the ſenſe here intended and meant; yea and when they ſhall thus reign, they ſhall be free, yea for ever free, from all infirmity, ſickneſs, pain, grief, death, <hi>&amp;c. Luk.</hi> 20. 35, 36. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 1-4. But to this we ſhall not further enlarge in this place.</p>

Indeed, if this Kingdom were ſuch an one as ſome ſay <hi>Cerinthus</hi> dreamt it ſhould be, as it is reported thus of him, <hi>[The opinion of Cerinthus was this, That the Kingdom of Chriſt ſhould be here on the earth; and look what he himſelf, being very carnal, luſted after for the pampering of his paunch, the ſame he dreamed ſhould come to paſs,</hi> to wit, <hi>the ſatisfying of the belly, and the things under the belly, with meats, drinks, marriages, feſtival-days, ſacrifices and ſlaughters for oblations; whereby he imagined he ſhould conceive greater joy and pleaſure,</hi> Euſebius, <hi>Book</hi> 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 24.] I ſay, if it were ſuch an one as in which the reigners ſhould enjoy all carnal pleaſures and delights, and be ſatiated therewith, it were not worthy deſiring, hoping, or waiting patiently for; but ſuch thoughts are to be abhorred by us concerning it. It's true indeed, it ſhall be upon the Earth, as here it is ſaid, and as we ſhall ſhew, God willing; and it's good for us to take away the precious from the vile, and not to throw away the wheat with the chaff: but it ſhall not be ſuch a Kingdom as he is ſaid to have dreamt it ſhall be; for the then reigners ſhall hunger no more, neither thirſt any more (after corporal meat and drink), <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 15, 16. neither ſhall they marry, nor be given in marriage any more, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. 35, 36. Indeed, <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> during that time, will build, and plant, eat, and drink, and marry, <hi>&amp;c.

And ſurely, this is one reaſon, on which we are inſiſting; becauſe theſe Kings, when they reign, ſhall reign as Prieſts alſo, and ſhall be a moſt religious, holy, heavenly people; and ſometimes when their reigning is ſpoken of, they are only called <hi>Prieſts;</hi> as they ſhall be Prieſts of God, and of Chriſt, and ſhall reign with him, <hi>&amp;c. Rev.</hi> 20. 6. And again, this glorious Kingdom is ſometimes called a <hi>Sabbatiſm,</hi> or a keeping of a Sabbath; and ſo this Kingdom may be called a <hi>Sabbatical Kingdom, Heb.</hi> 4. 8, 9. to denote the perpetual holineſs of it: A Sabbath was not only a ceſſation from all manner of ſervile work; but it was ſet apart by God for more ſolemn wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon, and worſhipping him; and therefore the Lord commanded his people, to remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 8. and they were not to do their own pleaſure thereon, to wit, on Gods holy day; but to call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, <hi>&amp;c.

So when this Kingdom of Chriſt ſhall come, then thoſe that ſhall reign with him, even all his Saints and holy Ones, ſhall keep a perpetual Sabbath, and ſing forth <hi>Hallelujah's,</hi> and it will then be their great delight to ſerve the Lord in his glorious Temple.</p>
                  <p>And this will be a righteous reign alſo; there will then be no cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, nor complaining in the ſtreets, as too too often now there is: but then a King ſhall reign in righteouſneſs: he hath prepared his throne for judgment: and he ſhall judg the world in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and miniſter judgment to the people in uprightneſs; and Princes, even theſe reigners with Chriſt, ſhall rule in judgment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. 14, 15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 1. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 7, 8. and 67. 4. and 82. and 96. 11, 13. and 98. 4, 9. <hi>Micah</hi> 4. 1-5. <hi>Behold, the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will raiſe up unto David a righteous branch, and a King ſhall reign and proſper, and ſhall execute judgment and juſtice in the earth: In his days Judah ſhall be ſaved, and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely,</hi> &amp;c.

And hereby alſo it appears the Saints ſhall reign on the earth, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>When the thouſand years of their reign are expired, Satan ſhall be looſed out of his priſon, and ſhall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battel, the number of whom is as the ſand of the ſea; and they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compaſſed the beloved City;</hi> to wit, the children of the firſt Reſurrection, or the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reigning Saints, which very plainly ſhews they ſhall reign on the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>But now when with the Scripture we ſay, they ſhall reign on the earth; we intend not nor mean they ſhall reign on the earth in this old and corruptible ſtate of it, but when God ſhall make it new, or renew the face of it; this he hath promiſed to do in due ſeaſon; and faithful is he that hath promiſed, who alſo will do it. <hi>For behold, ſaith the Lord God, I create new Heavens, and a new earth, and the former ſhall not be remembred, nor come into mind.</hi> And this promiſe is immediately added and ſubjoined, after he had been ſpeaking of his choſen ones bleſſing themſelves in the earth,

and ſwearing in the earth: To give us to underſtand of what earth he ſpeaks in this matter, namely, of the new one; conſider <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 15-17. ſee alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 66. 22-24. To the ſame purpoſe alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, acquainting the believers, <hi>That as the old world being overflowed with water periſhed, ſo the Heavens and the earth which are now by the ſame word are kept in ſtore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved unto fire,</hi> &amp;c.<hi>—Nevertheleſs</hi> (ſaith he, namely) <hi>though the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Earth which are now, ſhall be diſſolved by fire, we according to his promiſe look for new Heavens and a new Earth, wherein dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 5-13.

He hath promiſed, ſaying, <hi>Yet once more I ſhake not the Earth only, but alſo Heaven. And this word, yet once more, ſignifieth the removing of thoſe things that are ſhaken, as of thoſe things that are made, that thoſe things that cannot be ſhaken may remain; wherefore we receiving a Kingdom which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be moved, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 12. 26-28. with <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 6-8.

So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> when he is ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the ſuffering children of Gods being glorified together: and ſaying, <hi>I reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed on us.</hi> He then in the verſes following gives us to underſtand, when this glory ſhall be revealed on them, and where they ſhall be thus glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, to wit, on the earth, when the times of the reſtitution of all things ſhall come: ſee and conſider <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17-18, 19-21. And certainly when the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſo frequently in one <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſpeaks of, and aſſures the future happineſs of the Saints in theſe expreſſions, to wit, <hi>Thoſe that wait upon the Lord ſhall inherit the earth.—The meek ſhall inherit the earth, and ſhall delight themſelves in the abundance of peace.—Such as be bleſſed of him ſhall inherit the earth.—The righteous ſhall inherit the land, or earth.—Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he ſhall exalt thee to inherit the land,</hi> or <hi>earth,</hi> Pſal. 37. 4, 9, 11, 22, 29, 34. In all theſe aſſertions and promiſes, there is reſpect had unto the new earth; and theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſhall not be compleatly fulfilled or accompliſhed until God according to his promiſe makes new Heavens, and a new Earth. And this will appear if we duly and diligently conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſubjects of this Bleſſedneſs, or perſons, or manner of
<pb n="863" facs="tcp:48916:375"/>
perſons unto whom it is aſſured that they ſhall inherit the earth, and they are <hi>the truſters in the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 37. 3. the waiters on him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. the meek, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. ſuch as be bleſſed of him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. the righteous, <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. ſuch as wait upon him and keep his way, <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. that is to ſay, theſe perſons as ſuch manner of perſons, as waiters on the Lord, meek, righteous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be thus bleſſed; now certainly ſuch manner of perſons have hitherto inherited but a little part of the earth comparatively; and what they have ſo inherited, they have ſo done, not as Saints and righteous ones, but upon an humane and civil account and conſideration; not as ſons of God, but as children of men. <hi>The earth hath he</hi> (in this day) <hi>given to the children of men,</hi> Pſal. 115. 14-16. Therefore it appears theſe Promiſes are not yet accompliſhed: As alſo further appears,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that this Bleſſedneſs is Prophetically ſpoken of, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed as future, and not enjoyed in <hi>David</hi>'s time, no not in his old age, for he was now old, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 25. And though God gave him a great name, and ſubdued unto him his enemies round about, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. Nor were theſe Promiſes fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Solomons</hi> days, though then <hi>Iſrael</hi> had great reſt and peace; as it is ſaid by the Lord to <hi>David, Behold a ſon ſhall be born unto thee, who ſhall be a man of reſt, and I will give him reſt from all his enemies round about, for his name ſhall be Solomon; and I will give peace and quietneſs unto Iſrael in his days,</hi> 1 Chron. 22. 9, 10. with 1 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 4, 5. Yet I ſay theſe promiſes were not compleatly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in his days, which are mentioned in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. though they might in ſome firſt fruits; for <hi>Solomon</hi> in his days, and in his beſt days alſo, when he wrote the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> ſpeaks as his father <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had done, Prophetically of theſe things, and in much what the ſame language, ſaying, <hi>The upright ſhall dwell in the land,</hi> or <hi>earth, and the perfect ſhall remain it,</hi> Prov. 2. 21. And again he ſaith, <hi>The righteous ſhall never be removed,</hi> to wit, <hi>they ſhall inhabit or inherit the earth;</hi> as appears by the oppoſition in the latter part of the verſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 30. Yea, that theſe promiſes were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly performed in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s days, which we have mentioned in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. nor in the days of any of the good Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding him, is alſo evident in that our Saviour uſing <hi>Davids</hi> words, ſpeaks ſtill Prophetically, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed are the meek, for they ſhall</hi> (not do, or have done, but ſhall) <hi>inherit the earth,</hi> Mat. 5. 5. And as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſaith, <hi>If Jeſus</hi> (or <hi>Joſhua) had given them reſt, he would not have ſpoken of another day: there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth</hi>
                     <pb n="864" facs="tcp:48916:376"/>
                     <hi>therefore a reſt for the people of God,</hi> Heb. 4. 7-9. So we may ſay, If the meek and righteous had inherited the earth in <hi>Davids,</hi> or <hi>Solomons</hi> days, or in the times of any of the good Kings after them; our Saviour, our Jeſus, would not have ſpoken of a future time as he doth: the performance of theſe promiſes therefore ſtill remaineth to the people of God. And yet ſurely in the reign of <hi>David, Solomon, &amp;c.</hi> the righteous had as many <hi>Halcyonian</hi> days, and as much tranquillity for enjoying their religious Aſſemblies, and worſhipping God, as under the Empire of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> or as under the Empire of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> or any ſucceeding Emperours, and more. Yea, that theſe promiſes were not fulfilled in <hi>Solomons</hi> days, nor in <hi>Conſtantines;</hi> nor before our days, nor are yet, appears moſt evidently in what we have yet further to add: That is to ſay,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When the holy ones ſhall compleatly inherit the earth, and as is promiſed in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. the wicked ſhall be deſtroyed out of it, which without doubt they have not been, nor are to this day: ſee to this purpoſe what is ſaid in that <hi>Pſalm</hi> we are ſtill referring to: <hi>Evil doers ſhall be cut off, but thoſe that wait upon the Lord ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the earth: for yet a little while, and the wicked ſhall not be: yea thou ſhalt diligently c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the meek ſhall inherit the earth, and ſhall delight themſelves in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of peace.—Such as be bleſſed of him ſhall inherit the earth, and they that be curſed of him ſhall be cut off.—The ſeed of the wicked ſhall be cut off. The righteous ſhall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever. Wait upon the Lord, and keep his way, and he ſhall exa't thee to inherit the land,</hi> or <hi>earth. When the wicked are cut off thou ſhalt ſee it.</hi> Pſal. 37. 9. 11-13, 22, 28, 29, 34. And as it hath been obſerved, ſo it is obſervable, the firſt time Hallelujah is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Scriptures of the Prophets, is when the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> thus imprecates: <hi>Let the ſinners be conſumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more.—Hallelujah, or praiſe ye the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 104. 30-35.

And the four and twenty Elders, and the four living Creatures fell down and worſhipped God that ſate on the Throne, ſaying, Allelujah.—.And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thundrings, ſaying, Allelujah, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth, &amp;c.</hi> Rev. 18. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. 1, 2, 3-6, 8. 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

By all which it evidently appears, that the meek and righteous ones have never yet inherited the earth, as it's propheſied they ſhall do; nor ſhall they ſo do till this world be diſſolved, when will be the perdition of ungodly men, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 6, 7. nor until God ſhall make new Heavens, and a new Earth, as we have many times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid. And then indeed they ſhall be bleſſed, and reign on the earth, and inherit the earth and all things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. 1, 2. ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 1-5-7. But this will alſo further appear in, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by what followeth to be yet conſidered by us.</p>
                  <p>But though theſe Saints and all that are Chriſts at his coming, ſhall reign on and inherit the earth, as we have ſaid; yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears they ſhall have the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> as their inheritance in ſome peculiar conſideration. Indeed God promiſed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he ſhould be the heir of the world, and this promiſe was made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or reſpected, not <hi>Abraham</hi> only, but him and his ſeed, and that not thorow the Law, but through the righteouſneſs of faith; and it is of faith that it might be by grace, to the end the promiſe might be ſure to the whole ſeed, not to that only which is of the Law, but to that alſo which is of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is the father of us all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 9-13-16. But yet the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was by promiſe and Covenant aſſured to him for a poſſeſſion in ſome peculiar ſenſe, even to him and his ſeed, I mean the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> when it is made new, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 1, 5.
<pb n="866" facs="tcp:48916:377"/>
and when it ſhall be, as in due ſeaſon it ſhall be, an Heavenly Country, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13-16. ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 14-17. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 7, 8. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. 3, 4. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 28. 13, 14. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 15-19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If it be ſaid, This Covenant and Promiſe made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> concerning the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was fulfilled, when God brought his ſeed by <hi>Joſhua</hi> into it, and then and afterwards ſetled them in it; and therefore the accompliſhment thereof is not ſtill to be expected and waited for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this Objection I ſhall ſay theſe things:</p>
                  <p>1. No doubt in ſome firſt-fruits, and in part, that Covenant and promiſe was fulfilled and accompliſhed then; as is ſignified to us in what is ſaid, to wit, <hi>The Lord gave unto Iſrael all the land which he ſware to give unto their fathers; and they poſſeſſed it, and dwelt therein: and the Lord gave them reſt round about, according to all that be ſware unto our fathers—There failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord had ſpoken unto the houſe of Iſrael, all came to paſs,</hi> Joſh. 21. 43<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 45. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. 4.</p>
                  <p>2. But yet i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> doth appear, that that Covenant is not compleatly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled and accompliſhed, if we conſider theſe following particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. The land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was not only promiſed to be given to the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to himſelf alſo: as the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee.—And I will give unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee, the land wherein thou art a ſtranger, all the land of Canaan,</hi> Gen. 17. 7, 8. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 14-17. And the like alſo he promiſed unto <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the heirs with him of the ſame promiſe, to wit, that he would give the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> unto them, and to their ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 3, 4. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 28. 13, 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 8-12. But now none of theſe Patriarchs ever enjoyed this land which was ſo promiſed to them: as <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaith concerning <hi>Abraham, God gave him none in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eritance in it, no not to ſet his foot on; yet he promiſed that he would give it to him for a poſſeſſion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 5. yea concerning them all it is ſaid, <hi>By faith Abraham ſojourned in the land of promiſe, as in a ſtrange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Iſaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the ſame promiſe. And theſe all died in faith, not receiving the promiſes, but having ſeen them afar of, they were perſwaded of them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8, 9-13, 14. 39, 40. By which it doth plainly appear, that that promiſe is not yet compleatly fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>2. We have again apt occaſion to uſe thoſe words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="867" facs="tcp:48916:377"/>
here, which were lately referred to: <hi>If Jeſus</hi> (to wit, <hi>Joſhua) had given them reſt</hi> (namely, in a full and compleat conſideration) <hi>he would not have ſpoken of another day. There remaineth therefore</hi> (even when the Apoſtle thus wrote) <hi>a reſt to the people of God,</hi> Heb. 4. 7-9. with <hi>Joſh.</hi> 21 44. and 22. 4. And this Reſt will not be compleatly and gloriouſly enjoyed by them, until the Lord Jeſus be revealed (not in, but) from Heaven with his mighty Angels, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 9. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 5. the times of compleat reſt and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will come from the preſence of the Lord, when God ſhall ſend us Jeſus, and when the times of reſtitution of all things ſhall come, to wit, when God ſhall make new and renew all things, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 19, 20. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17-23.</p>
                  <p>3. The land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was by an everlaſting Covenant aſſured to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, for an everlaſting poſſeſſion; ſo God ſaith to <hi>Abraham, I will give unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee, the land wherein thou art a ſtranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlaſting poſſeſſion,</hi> &amp;c. Gen. 17. 7, 8. To the ſame purpoſe alſo <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Joſeph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz, in the land of Canaan, and bleſſed me, and ſaid unto me,—I will give this land to thy ſeed after thee, for an everlaſting poſſeſſion,</hi> Gen. 48. 3, 4. Now ſurely we may ſay this promiſe is not yet fulfilled com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly to the ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob:</hi> for <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh enjoyed it but a little time; the Ten Tribes were carried captive about ſeven hundred years after they were ſetled in <hi>Canaan</hi> by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and are not returned from that Captivity unto this day, and they were the greateſt part of that Nation. And the Prophet ſaith, <hi>The people of thine holineſs have poſſeſſed it but a little while, Iſa.</hi> 63. 18. And <hi>Judah</hi> hath been ejected out of it about ſixteen hundred years; ſo that as yet neither <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor their ſeed, have had it for an everlaſting poſſeſſion as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>4. Yes, it doth appear that that Covenant reſpected not their ſeed after the fleſh only, or fully, but the ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> even all that are Chriſts, who ſhall in due time have that Covenant fulfilled and performed to them, and ſhall poſſeſs the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when it is an heavenly Country, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13, 14, 16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 7-16, 17-29.</p>
                  <p>And in this heavenly Country they ſhall reign at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the City of the great King, even in the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which God will create. So the Lord when he promiſeth he will make new

Heavens and a new Earth, immediately ſaith, <hi>But be you glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create, for behold I create Jeruſalem a rejoicing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 17, 18. And the Lords remembrancers are called upon and provoked, not to keep ſilence, and to give him no reſt, till he eſtabliſh and till he make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a praiſe in the earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 1, 6, 7. I mean the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the holy and heavenly City, which God himſelf will create. Indeed it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the old <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the former City that was ſo called will be built again by the natural <hi>Iſrael, Jer.</hi> 30. 4-18. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. 38-40. but of this new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of which we are ſpeaking, God himſelf will be the builder and maker, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 9, 10. for which <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> looked, but never yet enjoyed it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 15, 16. [ſee the notes before on <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12.] <hi>The Lord of hoſts ſhall reign in mount Zion, and in Jeruſalem, and before his Ancients gloriouſly,</hi> Iſa. 24. 23. At that time, namely, when the Ten Tribes are returned, they ſhall call <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Throne of the Lord, for he ſhall be there, and there reign, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 12-17. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48. 35. <hi>And to him that overcometh he will then grant to ſit with him in his Throne,</hi> Rev. 3. 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If any ſhould ſay, The new and holy <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> cannot mean a glorious place, but a glorious people, becauſe it is called, <hi>the Bride, the Lambs wife,</hi> Revel. 21. 2, 10, 11. To that I ſay:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It doth indeed appear that thereby we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a glorious and heavenly people, to wit, the children of the firſt Reſurrection, in that it is called the Bride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Rev. 19. 7, 8, 9. But yet,</p>
                  <p>2. It may ſignifie a glorious place alſo; as in former times the old <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſignified frequently both the City and Citizens there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and ſometimes the one, and ſometimes the other: and not only it may ſo ſignifie, but it doth appear to mean a glorious place alſo: Becauſe,</p>
                  <p>1. It is diſtinguiſhed from perſons even from thoſe that enter thereinto: as it is ſaid, <hi>There ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth,—but they which are written in the Lambs book of life, Rev.</hi> 21. 27. Even as in the Prophet, the inhabitants of that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> the Lord God will make, are diſtinguiſhed from that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous place, where it is ſaid, <hi>But be you glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: For behold I create Jeruſalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. And I will rejoice in Jeruſalem, and joy in my people, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 65. 18, 19. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 2-4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="869" facs="tcp:48916:378"/>
2. Nor doth <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s, the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s being called the <hi>Bride,</hi> the <hi>Lambs wife,</hi> hinder, but that it may alſo ſignifie a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious place; for a place may be ſaid to be married to the Lord, as it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt no more be termed, forſaken, neither ſhall thy land any more be termed, deſolate; but thou ſhalt be called Hephzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah, that is, my delight is in her; and thy land Beulah, that is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; for the Lord delighteth in thee, and thy land ſhall be married:</hi> to wit, unto the Lord alſo: compare <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 4, 5. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 65. 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>So that in ſhort, the place where the Saints and holy ones ſhall reign will be on the earth, the new earth, in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that Heavenly Country, at the new and holy Jeruſalem, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. and 87. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome will be ready to object and ſay, what? muſt the Saints come out of Heaven and reign on the earth? ſurely that will tend much to the abatement and leſſening of their glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this objection we have ſpoken ſomewhat formerly: [ſee the notes on <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12.] and therefore ſhall ſay the leſs to it here. But it doth plainly appear that they ſhall come out of Heaven who ſhall reign on the earth; ſo it is oft ſaid of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which ſignifies as we have ſaid, both a glorious place, and a glorious holy people. As, <hi>Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt.—And I will write upon him the name of the City of my God, new Jeruſalem, which cometh down out of Heaven from my God.</hi> [See the notes on <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12.] So the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>I John ſaw the holy City, new Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem coming down out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her husband.</hi> And again he ſaith, <hi>There came unto me one of the ſeven Angels, and talked with me, ſaying, Come hither, I will ſhew thee the Bride, the Lambs wife. And he carried me away in ſpirit to a great and high mountain, and ſhewed me that great city the holy Jeruſalem, deſcending out of Heaven,</hi> Rev. 21. 29, 9, 10. So here in this place, as we have ſaid before, not only the four living Creatures, but alſo the four and twenty Elders, even the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, and which were in Heaven, ſay, We, we who in our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are in Heaven, ſhall reign on the earth: [ſee notes on <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.]</p>
                  <p>Nor will it be any abatement or leſſening of their glory, ſo to do; no more than it will be to the Lord Jeſus, who alſo ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
<pb n="870" facs="tcp:48916:379"/>
or come down from Heaven, as 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 16. and they ſhall be with him, and he with them, as afterwards we ſhall ſhew, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 1-3. Yea to ſignifie, that their coming out of Heaven will be no abatement, or diminution of their glory, it is ſaid by the Apoſtle <hi>John, He ſhewed me that great City, the holy Jeruſalem coming down out of Heaven from God, having the glory of God, and her light was like unto a ſtone moſt precious, even like a Jaſpar-ſtone, clear as cryſtal,</hi> Rev. 21, 10. 11-26, 27.</p>
                  <p>Over whom ſhall they ſo reign? and that will be over the earth, to wit, over the Inhabitants thereof; as it is ſaid of the Lord Jeſus, with whom they ſhall ſo reign, <hi>The Lord ſhall be King over all the earth, Zach.</hi> 14. 9. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47. 2.

                  <p>To this we ſhall ſpeak a little diſtinctly and particularly: And ſo</p>
                  <p>1. When ſhall they ſo reign? To this we have often intimately given anſwer before, namely, that they ſhall not ſo do while they are in mortal bodies, nor on the earth in this corruptible ſtate; but when God, according to his promiſe, ſhall make all things new. And ſo we ſay again, they ſhall not reign, as is here ſpoken of, till the dead in Chriſt are raiſed again, to wit, in the reſurrection of the juſt, when none but the righteous ones ſhall be raiſed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 14. There is an order in the reſurrection, as the Apoſtle gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand: Indeed, There will be a reſurrection of the dead, both of the juſt and unjuſt: <hi>As in Adam all dye, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive: But every man in his own order, Chriſt the firſt-fruits;</hi> he is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed long before the reſt of the dead, and hath been ſo above Sixteen hundred years already<hi>: Afterwards, they that are Chriſts at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> (and they only) and ſo, they alſo will be raiſed long before the reſt of the dead, namely, a Thouſand years, whether more ſtrictly, or largely taken, and more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4,—12.

Now then at Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the dead in Chriſt ſhall be raiſed, and the ſurviving of that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy changed: As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Them which ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him: for this we ſay unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord, ſhall not prevent them which are aſleep: for the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the</hi>

In order whereto, they <hi>ſhall be changed: In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt trump, (for the trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible, and we ſhall be changed)</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 14,—17. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 51-53. Then ſhall that which was propheſied of ſo long ſince be fulfilled: <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, with my dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhall they ariſe: awake and ſing ye that dwell in the duſt,</hi> &amp;c. name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, They ſhall then ſing gloriouſly that ſong there mentioned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 19. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 25. and 26. 1-5.

The time then, when they that are Chriſts ſhall reign on the earth, will be, after they are raiſed in the firſt and better Reſurrection: according to what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>They that ſhall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the reſurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: neither can they dye any more, for they are equal unto the angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> They that ſhall be accounted worthy to inherit and judg that world, are ſuch only as ſhall be accounted worthy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Reſurrection from the dead, from the reſt of the dead; which all ſhall not be, nor any, but the Children of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. 35, 36. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5.

<pb n="882" facs="tcp:48916:385"/>
ſaid therewith, we may ſpeak ſomething on <hi>v.</hi> 12. where we ſhall have more apt occaſion ſo to do. But here, let us a little enquire and conſider, whoſe Voice he heard; and that is here ſaid to be,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[Of Angels;]</hi> when that ſtrong Angel ſpoken of <hi>v.</hi> 2. made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation with a loud voice, ſaying, <hi>Who is worthy to open the Book, and to looſe the Seals thereof?</hi> then all were ſilent, and none did, or could return a word thereto: there was then ſilence in Heaven, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe inhabiters thereof, (as, <hi>ch.</hi> 8. 1.) but now, when that knot was untyed, and difficulty removed, and the Lamb had taken the Book, in order to the opening of it; and the redeemed ones un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God ſang that new Song before ſpoken of, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 10. Now their Tongues were looſed, when that glorious one had undertaken to looſe the Book; And the Apoſtle tells us here, <hi>I heard the Voice of many Angels,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>[Angel]</hi> is a Name, not of Nature, but of Office<hi>:</hi> and therefore it is ſometimes given to any Meſſenger indefinitely; and many times in the three firſt Chapters of this Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> to the Meſſengers, Biſhops, or Over-ſeers of the ſeven Churches. [See the Notes before on <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 20.] But here we are to underſtand the word <hi>[Angels]</hi> to mean, thoſe Spirits, or ſpiritual Beings, ſo called<hi>:</hi> As it is ſaid, <hi>He maketh his Angels Spirits,</hi> Pſal. 104. 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 7. for they are diſtinguiſhed from him that ſits on the Throne, and from the Lamb; and from all the Saints and redeemed ones unto God; and from every Creature ſpoken of, and mentioned in <hi>v.</hi> 13. of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>And ſo we may ſay a little particularly and diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Theſe Angels are Spirits, or ſpiritual Beings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 7. And have not fleſh and bones, as Men, and many other Creatures, have: As our Saviour ſaith, <hi>A Spirit hath not fleſh and bones,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 39. Indeed Men have Spirits, but they are not Spirits meerly, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 22. and <hi>ch.</hi> 27. 16. And alſo the Angels were at firſt made in a glorious condition, more glorious than Mankind was: As the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> intimates when he ſaith, <hi>Thou madeſt Man a little lower than the Angels,</hi> Pſ. 8. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And the Angels are created Spirits; As it is ſaid, <hi>He [maketh.] his Angels Spirits,</hi> Pſ. 104. 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 7. And ſo they are diſtinct from, and infinitely inferiour to, him that fits upon the Throne, who hath created all things; and for his pleaſure they are, and were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 9, 11. God indeed is a Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24. But not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<hi>:</hi> He is from everlaſting to everlaſting God, and is the Creator
<pb n="883" facs="tcp:48916:385"/>
and Former of all things; and ſo alſo the Creator of theſe Spirits we are ſpeaking of, <hi>Iſay</hi> 40. 26. The Father of Spirits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9. He created Heaven, and the things that are therein; to wit, the Angels in Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 5, 6. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 36. Upon this account the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> thus ſpeaks, and ſaith, <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord all his Angels: Let them praiſe the Name of the Lord; for he commanded, and they were created,</hi> Pſ. 148. 2, 5. And he created them by Jeſus Chriſt, by him he created all things, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 9. And who is the true God, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. [See the Notes before on <hi>v.</hi> 8.] He is the Image of the inviſible God, the Firſt-born of every Creature: for by him were all things created that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, viſible and inviſible; whether Thrones or Dominions, or Principalities or Powers: All things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, <hi>&amp;c. Col.</hi> 1. 15, 17. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1, 3. And alſo particularly, the Angels are diſtinct from the third Perſon in the infinitely glorious Trinity, who is frequently called, the Spirit, the holy Spirit; and in this Book, the ſeven Spirits<hi>:</hi> [See Notes before on <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 4.] I ſay, theſe Angels are diſtinguiſhed from the holy Spirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. And they are infinitely below, and inferiour to him; for by him they alſo were created: By the Word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the Hoſt of them, (and ſo the Angels alſo) by the Spirit of his Mouth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 6. By his Spirit he hath garniſhed the Heavens, to wit, with theſe Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as with precious ſtones, <hi>Job.</hi> 26. 13. with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. 6. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 19.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And all the Angels were of God made good<hi>:</hi> for God ſaw eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that he had made, and behold it was very good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 31. And in an high, honourable, and happy condition, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 4, 6. So as then theſe Morning-ſtars ſang together, and all the Sons of God ſhouted for joy, <hi>Job.</hi> 38. 4, 7. But all of them abode not in the truth, but ſome of them ſinned, and fell from that good, holy, and glorious eſtate they were created in, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to Hell, and delivered them into Chains of Darkneſs, to be reſerved unto Judgment, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. The Angels which kept not their firſt Eſtate, or Principality, but left their own, or, proper Habitation, he hath reſerved in everlaſting Chains under Darkneſs, unto the judgment of the great Day, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6. And ſome of the Angels did ſtand and abide in that excellent ſtate and condition in which they were at firſt created: And of theſe latter we have here to ſpeak, and not of the former, who have left and loſt the purity and integrity of their Nature, in which
<pb n="884" facs="tcp:48916:386"/>
they were made of God. And indeed the Angels that did abide in their holy and happy eſtate, appear to be the Perſons here intended; By their diſpoſition, they are about the Throne in Heaven, and about the living Creatures and Elders<hi>:</hi> And by their ſaying with a loud voice, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain,</hi> &amp;c. And in that they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from every Creature under the Earth, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. And therefore of theſe excellent Angels we ſhall ſpeak, though ſome of the things ſpoken may be extended to the Angels that ſinned alſo. Nor ſhall we curiouſly enquire into, or meddle with their orders or degrees, though yet ſurely, ſome of them are more excellent than other ſome, as we have ſaid. [See Notes on <hi>v.</hi> 2.] but ſhall ſpeak of thoſe things that are more plain, and more plainly revealed and declared concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: As to ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Theſe Angels which abode in the truth are ſignified to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Light, in that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Satan</hi> himſelf is transformed into an Angel of Light; intimating that there are ſuch Angels, and that Satan is none of them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13, 15. And they are called Angels of Light, to denote their brightneſs and the purity of their Nature, and where they dwell, to wit, in the Light; and to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from the fallen Angels, which are Angels of Darkneſs, and delivered into Chains of Darkneſs, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Jude</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are very frequently called the Angels of the Lord, of God, of Chriſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 8, 9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 41. and in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, to diſtinguiſh them from the Angels which kept not their firſt eſtate, called, the Devil and his Angels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41. And the Dragon, called, the Devil and Satan, and his Angels, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 7, 9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are called, holy Angels; and ſo are all theſe Angels we are ſpeaking of: Hence whereas ſometimes it is ſaid, The Son of Man ſhall come in the glory of his Father with his Angels<hi>:</hi> In other places it is ſaid, The Son of Man ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 27. with <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 38. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 26. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 31. to ſignifie they are ſinleſs and pure from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and devoted unto God<hi>:</hi> and to diſtinguiſh them from the wicked one, and his wicked Angels, or Spirits, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 13, 14. and <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 45. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are called <hi>elect Angels,</hi> ſo the Apoſtle calls them when he ſaith to <hi>Timothy, I charge thee before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Elect Angels,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 21. to denote their pretiouſneſs and excellency; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 6. and to diſtinguiſh them from the Angels who
<pb n="885" facs="tcp:48916:386"/>
left their proper habitation, who are become reprobate, becauſe the Lord hath rejected them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. with <hi>Jude</hi> 6. with <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 30.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are alſo ſaid to be Angels in, and of Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 36. <hi>Mark.</hi> 12. 25. and <hi>ch.</hi> 13. 22. becauſe they dwell there, which was indeed the proper habitation of all the Angels at firſt, but the ſinning Angels kept it not, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. but theſe Holy Ones kept it, and Heaven is their dwelling place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. Hence alſo they are called, the Heavenly Hoſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 35. And they always behold the Face of Chriſts Father which is in Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 10. and delight in Heaven and Heavenly things: And in every reſpect they are called, <hi>Angels in Heaven,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from the Infernal Ones, who are caſt down to Hell, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are good Angels; their goodneſs indeed extends not to the Lord, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 16. 2, 3. but they are good and loving to Mankind, and eſpecially to thoſe of Mankind that believe<hi>:</hi> So it is ſaid, <hi>Thou art good in my ſight as an Angel of God,</hi> 1 Sam. 29. 8. And they appear to be good and loving to Mankind, in that when Chriſt, the Saviour of the World was born, they praiſed God and ſaid, <hi>Glory be to God in the higheſt, on Earth Peace, good-will towards Men,</hi> Luke 9. 2, 13, 14. And there is joy in the preſence of the Angels of God, over one Sinner that repenteth, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 7, 10. And they are, and are ſignified to be, good Angels, to diſtinguiſh them from the evil one and his evil Angels, who ſeek the ruine, and everlaſting deſtruction of men: for Satan was a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayer from the beginning, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 78. 49. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 21. and <hi>ch.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 12, 15.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And theſe good Angels are excellent Creatures, as appears in ſome good meaſure in what hath been ſaid of them already; and as will further appear if we conſider what followeth. That is to ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

yet they have much more knowledge than men have; as our Saviour gives us to underſtand, when he ſaith, <hi>Of that Day and Hour knoweth no Man, no not the Angels of the Heavens:</hi> Implying, they know more than any meer man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 36. <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 22.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are alſo very ſtrong and powerful: as it is ſaid, <hi>Bleſs the Lord ye his Angels that excel in ſtrength,</hi> or are mighty, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 103. 20. they are greater in power than men are, or any other Creature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14. Hence they are called powers, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 22. Indeed, it doth appear, that ſome of theſe Glorious Creatures excel others of them in ſtrength: [See notes before on <hi>v.</hi> 2.] but yet they are all of them very ſtrong and powerful: And hence alſo whereas it is ſaid in one place, <hi>The Son of Man ſhall come in the Glory of his Father with his Angels:</hi> It is thus expreſt to us in another, <hi>The Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels:</hi> ſignifying to us, that all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God are mighty in ſtrength. Compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 27. with 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 7. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 31. And to this we may have further oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are very ſwift, and ſpeedy in their motion from one place to another; with two Wings they do fly<hi>:</hi> And ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>One of the Seraphims flew unto me,</hi> Iſay 6. 2, 6. They can come from Heaven to Earth inſtantly; as it is ſaid, <hi>Suddenly there was with the Angel a multitude of the Heavenly Hoſt,</hi> Luke 2. 13. To the ſame purpoſe alſo is that of the Prophet; whilſt I was ſpeaking in Prayer, ſaith he, <hi>Even the Man</hi> Gabriel, <hi>whom I had ſeen in the Viſion at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, being cauſed to fly ſwiftly, touched me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 21. they have not ſuch groſs earthly Bodies as we have, nor are hindred or retarded by ſuch letts and obſtacles as we are.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are very watchful Creatures, and need not ſleep to refreſh them as we do, while we are here in mortal corruptible bodies. Hence they are called watchers, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 13, 17, 23.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are very glorious Creatures, full of ſplendor, luſtre, bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Majeſty<hi>:</hi> Hence we hear of the Cherubims of Glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 5. and the Glory of the Angels, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 26. So alſo it is ſaid, <hi>All that ſate in the Council—ſaw</hi> Stephens <hi>Face, as it had been the Face of an Angel,</hi> Acts 6. 15. So <hi>Manoahs</hi> Wife ſaid to her Husband, that he that appeared to her was, a man of God, and his countenance was like the countenance of an Angel of God, very terrible, <hi>Judges</hi> 13. 6, 15, 16, 21. And ſo much alſo is ſignified, in that they are called, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of light,</hi> as is before ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are Immortal Creatures, ſuch as ſhall not, cannot, dye<hi>:</hi>
                     <pb n="887" facs="tcp:48916:387"/>
as our Saviour ſignifies when he ſaith, <hi>neither can they dye any more, for they are equal with the Angels,</hi> Luke 20. 36. And ſo they ſhall for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoy that honour, and happineſs, and holineſs, of which they are poſſeſſed.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. They have an excellent Voice or Language, as the Apoſtle inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates when he ſaith, <hi>Though I ſpeak with the Tongue of—Angels,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. The conſideration of what we have ſaid already, concerning theſe Glorious Creatures, is uſeful to deliver and preſerve us from the errour of the <hi>Sadducees</hi> new and old, who ſay there is neither Angel nor Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 8. they are herein more bruitiſh than the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> were; for they confeſſed there were ſuch Creatures, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 8, 9. yea that there are ſuch Spiritual Beings, was alſo acknowledged by an unproſelyted Gentile, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 22. and by an Heathen, to wit, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſh</hi> King of <hi>Gath,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 29. 9.</p>
                  <p>2. VVe may be led, by occaſion of the excellency of the Angels, in ſome little meaſure, to conſider and conceive of his infinite glory and majeſty, who is the Creatour, and former of all things: So the Lord from the ſtrength and excellency of ſome of his Creatures, gives us to underſtand, that he who is the Creatour of them muſt needs be infinitely more glorious and powerful: So he ſaith of <hi>Leviathan;</hi> none is ſo fierce that dare ſtir him up, who then is able to ſtand before me? <hi>Job</hi> 41. 10, 11. <hi>Iſay</hi> 40. 26, 28.</p>
                  <p>3. We may in ſome ſmall meaſure conceive from hence, what glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and excellency they ſhall arrive at, and partake of, who are called to the fellowſhip of God's Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. Man was made in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and Creation, a little lower than the Angels, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 8. 4, 5. And ſo indeed, for a little while, our Lord Jeſus, the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> was alſo inferiour to them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 9. But for the ſufferings of death he was crowned with Glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. and hath by Inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 18, 22. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 22. He hath advanced our nature in his perſon far above all thoſe glorious Spirits; and they that ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy to obtain that World, and the Reſurrection from the Dead, ſhall be equal to the Angels, and be the Children of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Children of the Reſurrection, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 30. <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 25. <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 35, 36. they are called to the obtaining of the Glory of our Lord Jeſus, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 14. 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
                  <p>2. We have the number of theſe holy, happy, and glorious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures indefinitely intimated to us: <hi>[Many Angels, and the number of</hi>
                     <pb n="888" facs="tcp:48916:388"/>
                     <hi>them was ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands:]</hi> ſo many as no man can number. They are frequently ſignified to be a very great number, or an innumerable company of them; as will ſomewhat appear to us, if we conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The plain affirmations, and intimations given to us thereof in the Scriptures: So when <hi>Jacob</hi> went on his way, the Angels of God met him: and when <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw them, he ſaid, <hi>This is Gods Hoſt:</hi> and he called the name of that place <hi>Mahanaim,</hi> that is, two Hoſts. Now in that he called them [the Hoſt of God] he may hereby inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to us, the great number of them alſo: for we have that phraſe uſed concerning thoſe that came to aſſiſt <hi>David.</hi> At that time, day by day, there came to <hi>David</hi> to help him, until it was a great Hoſt, like the Hoſt of God: the number whereof was about, or above four hundred thouſand. Compare <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 1, 2. with 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 22, 38. Now if that Hoſt waiting upon, and encamping about <hi>Jacob,</hi> one Man, was ſo great in number as four hundred thouſand, what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable multitude is there of them all? conſidering that there is alſo an innumerable company always about the Throne; and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saints were not without their Guards, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 34. 7. Nor Children, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 10.

                        </gap>s,</hi> to wit, Holy Angels; for the Law was given by the diſpoſition of them. Compare <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 2. with <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 53. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2. To the ſame purpoſe alſo the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>The Chariots of God are ten thouſand, even thouſands of Angels,</hi> Pſ. 68. 17. with 2 Kings 6. 17. And <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, <hi>thouſand thouſands miniſtred unto him, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him,</hi> Dan. 7. 10. So our Saviour ſaith to <hi>Peter, Thinkeſt thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he will preſently give me more than twelve Legions of Angels:</hi> A Roman Legion was, ſix thouſand; and ſo twelve Legions were ſeventy two thouſand and more, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 53. There is a multitude of this Heavenly Hoſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 10, 13. an innumerable company of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. ten thouſands, or many myriads of them, <hi>Jude</hi> 14. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 27. and <hi>ch.</hi> 25. 31. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yea it is ſignified to us, that the number of the Heavenly Hoſt (as the Angels alſo are called, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 1, 2. <hi>Luke</hi> 2 13.) is ſo great as none can number them but he that made them; they know not their own number: this is peculiar to God, as the Lord ſignifies when he ſaith, <hi>Lift up your Eyes on high, and behold who hath created theſe things, that bringeth out their Hoſt by number:</hi> He calleth them all by names,
<pb n="889" facs="tcp:48916:388"/>
by the greatneſs of his might, for that he is ſtrong in power, not one faileth, <hi>Iſay</hi> 40. 26. The Hoſt of Heaven cannot be numbred, to wit, by any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>2. Yea this alſo will further appear, if we conſider the wonderful height of the Heavens in which theſe Angels dwell, <hi>Job</hi> 11. 8. and <hi>ch.</hi> 22. 12. the Heavens for height is unſearchable, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25 3. In the height whereof, the greatneſs of them alſo is ſignified to us: As the Heaven is high above the Earth, ſo great is his mercy toward them that fear him. The Heaven in ſome ſort exceeds the Earth in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as Gods mercy doth our fear toward him, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably as to us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 11. Heaven is a meaſureleſs, boundleſs place<hi>:</hi> It is impoſſible to all Creatures to meaſure Heaven, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 37. And if we ſuppoſe, that that upper and moſt noble part of Gods Creation is garniſhed, and repleniſhed with theſe glorious Creatures, as the lower part of his Creation is, with Creatures ſuitable thereto: He hath made of one blood all Nations of Men, for to dwell on all the Face of the Earth; and filled the Earth with other Creatures infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to Man, for his uſe and ſervice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 26. <hi>Jer.</hi> 27. 5. God himſelf formed the Earth, and made it; he hath eſtabliſhed it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited, (otherwiſe it had been made in vain,) <hi>Iſay</hi> 45. 18. So alſo is the great and wide Sea full of Gods riches, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both ſmall and great Beaſts, <hi>&amp;c. Pſ.</hi> 104. 24, 25. So we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the Heavens, that they are garniſhed, <hi>Job</hi> 26. 13. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with thoſe glorious Inhabitants, otherwiſe they had been alſo created in vain, <hi>Iſay</hi> 45. 18. Yea that part of the Heavens which is viſible to us, how full of Stars is it, and appears it to be in a clear Night? And there they are always, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 5. And if ſome one Planet be, as is conceived by ſome, much bigger than the Earth: how capacious, yea inconceivably boundleſs muſt the whole Heaven be! And how infinitely innumerable the Angels! As is in this Verſe alſo indefinitely intimated. Yea, if we alſo conceive how little room theſe Spirits, or ſpiritual Beings, take, (though yet they are finite, becauſe Creatures,) when a Legion, ſix thouſand, was in one Man, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 9, 15. <hi>Luke.</hi> 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>3. <hi>With a loud,</hi> or great, <hi>voice,]</hi> denotes their inſtantneſs, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs; as thoſe that would hear nothing that might hinder, or wave them from praiſing and extolling the Lamb. Thus we have this Phraſe uſed concerning the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were ſo earneſt to have Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that they would hear nothing to the contrary: <hi>They were inſtant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified: and the voices of them, and of the Chief Prieſts prevailed,</hi> Luke 23. 23. So theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were ſo inſtant with their loud voices, as if they reſolved here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to excell, and out-voice them who conſult to caſt down Chriſt from his excellency, Pſ. 62. 2, 4. And that all might give unto him the glory due unto his Name, and worſhip him, and none but Chriſt, and God in him, and no falſe object of worſhip, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>

                  <p>2. And it was good news they proclaimed, glad tidings of great joy to all People of Mankind, as <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 10, 14. Even the Contents of the Goſpel: And ſo they might well, and rejoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Sad news may be whiſpered out, (as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 19.) And they that bring in damnable hereſies, denying the Lord that bought them, do it many times privily, and in ſecret, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1.

                  <p>And that is, <hi>About the Throne:</hi> So here it is ſaid; <hi>I heard the voice of many Angels round about the Throne,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the number of them was ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands, ſaying with a loud voice:</hi> they knew it would be no offence, or grief of heart to him that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

VVhen the whole multitude of the Diſciples began to rejoice, and praiſe God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works that they had ſeen, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed be the King that cometh in the Name of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. It ſeems, ſome of the Phariſees were offended thereat, and diſpleaſed therewith: for they ſaid unto Jeſus; <hi>Maſter, rebuke thy Diſciples,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 37, 38, 39.

harmoniouſly, and with a loud noiſe, round about the Throne, on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide of it, as it were, cauſe their voice to enter into the Ears of him that ſate upon the Throne; it was not diſpleaſing, or diſhonouring to him, but that which tended to the honouring, and glorifying him. <hi>God hath committed all judgment to the Son, that all ſhould honour the Son as they honour the Father: He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father that hath ſent him Joh.</hi> 5. 22, 23.

                  <p>2. <hi>And Riches.]</hi> That is to ſay,</p>
                  <p>1. The Riches which are here below, for theſe are his alſo: the Gold and the Silver are his, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>The Earth is the Lords,</hi> even the Lord Chriſts, <hi>and the fulneſs thereof,</hi> Pſ. 24. 1. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 26, 28. with <hi>v.</hi> 21. God hath Crowned him with glory, and honour; and made him to have dominion over the works of his hands, and hath put all things under his feet: all Sheep, and Oxen, yea, and the Beaſts of the Field, the Fowl of the Air, and the Fiſh of the Sea, and whatſoever paſſeth thorow the Pathes of the Sea, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 5, 6, 8. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 6, 9. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 50. 11, 12. And the conſideration hereof might engage us to come unto, and follow him in the regeneration: for there ſhall be no want to them that fear him: <hi>The young Lions do lack and ſuffer hunger; but they that ſeek the Lord (Chriſt) ſhall not want any good thing,</hi> Pſ. 34. 8, 10. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3, 4. This is one great thing that Men are afraid of, that if they cleave to the Lord with full purpoſe, and follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth, they ſhall not be provided for of the things here below, but ſhall be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto neceſſity and poverty: But this is a miſtake, and groundleſs fear: for all things are delivered to him of the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 27, 28. And in exerciſing our ſelves to godlineſs, we exerciſe our ſelves to that which is profitable to all things, having the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. with <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 16. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 10, 13. with <hi>ch.</hi> 10. 23. Hence the wiſdom of God, to wit, Jeſus Chriſt, invites Men, to receive her inſtruction, and not Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and Knowledge rather than choice Gold: And to engage them ſo to do, ſhe propounds this as a powerful Motive and Argument; <hi>Riches are with me,</hi> Prov. 8. 10, 18. <hi>In her left hand are Riches,</hi> Prov. 3. 12, 16. <hi>He is a Sun and Shield; he will give grace and glory: no</hi>

He hath indeed been rich in good works, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 18.) his goodneſs was ſo great towards us, that he died for us, and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: his kindneſs was infinitely great in becoming our Saviour, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 4. And he is good to all: ſuch was his grace and goodneſs towards us, that though he was rich, for our ſakes he became poor; that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row his poverty we might be enriched, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8, 9. He hath Riches of Mercy; and being rich therein, he hath Riches of Patience and long-ſuffering towards impenitent ones, while it is called to day, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. becauſe he is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9, 15. And according to the riches of his mercy, quickens them who are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 4, 5. and remits, and pardons their ſins, who thorow his Name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7. with <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 43. and his mercy endures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternal life, <hi>Jude</hi> 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 23. Riches of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 4. He hath, by his blood, brought in everlaſting righteouſneſs, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24, 26. <hi>And his Name is</hi> Jehovah <hi>our righteouſneſs, Jer.</hi> 23. 6. Riches of Wiſdom and Underſtanding: <hi>In him are hid all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdom and knowledge, Col.</hi> 2. 3. Yea all the riches and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of grace, and ſpiritual bleſſings are treaſured up in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14, 16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. and <hi>ch.</hi> 2. 9, 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. and riches of glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 19. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 14. And theſe are the true Riches, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 11. As Chriſt is ſaid to be; the true Light, the true Bread, the true Vine: that is, they are the moſt excellent Riches, more excellent than theſe which are here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. As will appear if we conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The excellent nature of them, they are ſpiritual, but the other earthly and natural, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 11. and <hi>ch.</hi> 15. 44, 46. Theſe true Riches are ſuch as the holy Spirit is directing us to, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying before us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 14, 15. whereas our own wiſdom, which is ſenſual and deviliſh, is leading us to labour to be rich here below, and to lay up for our ſelves treaſures on earth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 15. with <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 4. And the true Riches are ſuch as are proper to enrich the Souls and Spirits of Men, how poor ſoever they are, as to theſe outward riches, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The true Riches are certain and durable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the other are called, and are, uncertain Riches, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17, 18. and ſuch as are but for a moment. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine Eyes on that</hi>

                     <hi>which is not? for Riches certainly make to themſelves wings, they flee like an Eagle toward Heaven,</hi> Prov. 23. 4, 5. And at furtheſt, they will leave us at death, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 49. 16, 17. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 19, 20. Riches are not for ever, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 24. And on this account the Holy Ghoſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth them that be rich in this World, not to be high-minded, nor truſt in theſe Riches, becauſe they are uncertain: But contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to do good therewith, and to be rich in good works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1. Tim. 6. 17, 18. But the true Riches which the Lamb hath worthily receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are certain and permanent: <hi>Riches and Honour are with me,</hi> ſaith Wiſdom, <hi>yea durable Riches,</hi> Prov. 8. 10, 18, 22, <hi>The things that are ſeen are temporal; but the things that are not ſeen are eternal,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Riches here below are empty, and unſatisfying: Vanity of Vanities, ſaith the Preacher, <hi>Vanity of Vanities; all is Vanity, Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>He that loveth Silver ſhall not be ſatisfied with Silver, nor he that loveth abundance with increaſe: this is alſo vanity,</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 10. Theſe Riches will not ſatisfie Mens Souls, nor fill their Bowels, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 19. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 8, 11. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 5. Men in labouring for theſe things, labour for that which will not ſatisfie, <hi>Iſay</hi> 55. 2. But now, theſe excellent Riches of Chriſt are ſuch as will indeed ſatisfie, and give compleat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to the Soul: He will cauſe them that love him to inherit ſubſtance, and he will fill all their treaſures, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 19, 21.

                  <p n="4">4. The Riches which are here below are unprofitable, they will not profit us in a day of wrath, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 4. they will not deliver Men from the wrath of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 19. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 18. Will he eſteem thy Riches? no, not Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Job 36. 18, 19. nor will they obtain his favour: though a Man would give all the ſubſtance of his Houſe for his love, it would utterly be contemned, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 7. nor will they purchaſe, or procure his Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 18, 20.

And herein he grapled with all our Enemies, that he might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome them. And hereby it appears that he was a ſtrong one, in that God laid ſuch burdens upon him. If we ſpeak of ſtrength, loe he was ſtrong, <hi>Job</hi> 9. 19. for he is the mighty God, <hi>Iſay</hi> 9. 6. And he is the Man of God's right hand, and the Son of Man, whom he made ſtrong for himſelf, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 80. 17. And the love of our bleſſed Redeemer appeared to be exceeding ſtrong, in bearing and enduring theſe heavy burdens<hi>:</hi> his love was ſtrong as death: many waters could not quench it, neither could the floods drown it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>2. And his ſtrength wonderfully appeared, in raiſing himſelf from the dead, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 19, 21. He laid down his life that he might take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: no Man took his life from him, but he laid it down of himſelf:

he had power to lay it down, and he had power to take it again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 17, 18. He was declared to be the Son of God in power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit of holineſs, by the reſorrection from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. As alſo herein his wonderful ſtrength appeared, in van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing and overcoming all our Enemies, he is the Lord ſtrong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battel, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 24. 8. He bare, even bare away, the ſins of many, or of the multitude, <hi>Iſay</hi> 53. 12. He made purgation of our ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. It was not poſſible that the blood of Goats and Calves could take away ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1, 4, 5. 8. and <hi>ch.</hi> 7. 18. But what the Law could not do in that it was weak thorow the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. And he hath overcome and aboliſhed Death, taken the ſting out of it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21. He hath, as to himſelf, been Death's Death, ſwallowed it up into victory, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>Iſay</hi> 25. 7.

He upholdeth all things by the word of his power, when he had by himſelf purged our ſins. It is by him that all things conſiſt, and ſtand together in that good order in which they are, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 17, 20. He is the very Baſis and Foundation on which all things ſtand<hi>:</hi> And on the ſhoulders of this ſtrong one is the government of the whole World laid: for the Father judgeth no Man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son, <hi>Iſay</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22.

                  <p>7. <hi>And Bleſſing.]</hi> This alſo the innumerable company of Angels acknowledges the Lamb to be worthy to receive: And this we may look upon,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. More generally; As bleſſing ſignifies all that is truly good and deſirable, as many times in Scripture it doth, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. So, good and bleſſing are uſed the one for the other, Compare <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 15. with <hi>v.</hi> 19. And ſo God hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly things in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. with all the bleſſings of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; As it is ſaid: <hi>Thou preventeſt him with the bleſſings of goodneſs, Pſ.</hi> 21. 3. He is full of grace and truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14, 16. In him dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all the fulneſs of the God-head bodily: And in him we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. and 2. 9, 10. In him there is the bleſſing of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 7. with <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 14. In him is the bleſſing of righteouſneſs, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Iſay</hi> 45. 24. And he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſhall receive the bleſſing from the Lord, and righteouſneſs from the God of his ſalvation, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 24. 1, 5. On him is the Spirit, that great bleſſing, <hi>Iſay</hi> 44. 3. with <hi>ch.</hi> 11. 2. and 42. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34. In him is the bleſſing of Life, of eternal Life, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 19. Here indeed God hath prepared for us, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us the bleſſing, even life for evermore, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 133. 3. with 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 11 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 4. And in due ſeaſon he ſhall gloriouſly receive the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> even the heavenly Country and Inheritance, for himſelf and his Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 4. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16, 29. And in him there is bleſſing for all the Nations and Families of the Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 18. and 26. 4. and <hi>ch.</hi> 28. 14. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 25. with <hi>Gal</hi> 3. 13,

14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72 17. <hi>Iſay</hi> 25. 6. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 31, 32. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 4, 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 16, 17, 21.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or as bleſſing is taken more paticulary and ſtrictly, for praiſe, or being well and honourably ſpoken of; and for thanks<hi>:</hi> So he is to be praiſed, thanked, and ſo bleſſed by us, and by all, eſpecially by his Saints and holy ones, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. So, bleſſing, and giving thanks, are uſed indifferently, and put one for the other. Compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26, 27. and <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 22, 23. with <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 19. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24. <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 6, 7 As alſo are, to bleſs and praiſe<hi>:</hi> As, <hi>I will bleſs the Lord at all times, his praiſe ſhall be continually in my Mouth, Pſ.</hi> 34. 1. So uſually, to bleſs, ſignifies to praiſe, or ſpeak well of, as <hi>Pſ.</hi> 100. 4. and 103. 1, 2, 21, 22. and 115. 17, 18, &amp;c. Thus indeed we have cauſe abundantly, and everlaſtingly, to bleſs him, even to give thanks unto him, and to ſpeak well of him, and praiſe him with our whole hearts and ſouls: he ought to be daily praiſed by us, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 72. 15. for his wonderful pity and kindneſs towards us, that love of his that paſſeth knowledge, in dying for all, riſing, and aſcending, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As it is ſaid; <hi>God is gone up with a ſhout,</hi> even he that firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into the lower-parts of the Earth, <hi>the Lord with the ſound of a Trumpet: Sing praiſes unto our God, ſing praiſes; ſing praiſes unto our King, ſing praiſes:—Sing ye praiſes with underſtanding,</hi> or every one that hath underſtanding, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47. 6, 7. and 68. 18, 20. And for his ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs in every reſpect: <hi>He is altogether lovely,</hi> no ſpot or blemiſh in him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10, 16. He is fairer than the Children of Men, grace is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into his lips, therefore God hath bleſſed him for ever. And therefore alſo ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, I will make thy Name to be remembred in all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations: therefore ſhall the people praiſe thee for ever and ever,</hi> Pſal. 45. 1, 2, 10. with <hi>v.</hi> 17. He is beautiful and glorious, excellent and comly; and there is none deſerves, on theſe accounts, ſo much to be praiſed as he, <hi>Iſay</hi> 4. 2. with 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 25.</p>
                  <p>And he hath power to bleſs us alſo; and God having raiſed him ſends him,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Preventingly, to bleſs all, in their proper ſeaſons and ages, in turning every one of them from their iniquities, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 25, 26. for him hath God exalted with his right hand a Prince and Saviour, to give repentance to ſinful and rebellious ones, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. And he comes by his Servants in his Goſpel, to open the Eyes of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſs of their ſins, &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 17, 18.</p>

2. And eſpecially, and with peculiar and following bleſſings, he comes to bleſs them that believe; as he bleſſed <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithful, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 6. He forgives them their ſins; even as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> deſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of the Man to whom the Lord imputeth righteouſneſs without works, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5, 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 43. and 13. 39. He makes them accepted in himſelf, who is <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> our righteouſneſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 6. They ſhall receive the bleſſing from the Lord, and righteouſneſs from the God of their ſalvation, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 24. 5. with <hi>v.</hi> 1. He pours out his Spirit unto them, and makes known his words unto them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Iſay</hi> 44. 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 37, 38. And gives unto them eternal life, and will in due ſeaſon raiſe them up to the glorious enjoyment thereof: <hi>for this is the will of him that ſent him, that every one that ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, ſhould have everlaſting life, and he will raiſe them up at the laſt day,</hi> Joh. 6. 40, 44. and 10 27, 28. and 17. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>2. Of whom is the Lamb that was ſlain worthy to receive thoſe excellent things before mentioned, and in ſome little meaſure ſpoken to? And to that we may ſay,</p>
                  <p>1. He is worthy to receive them of God his Father; and hath from him received all power, and riches, and wiſdom, and ſtrength, and honour, and glory, and bleſſing; as he is the Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus<hi>:</hi> He hath given all to him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred all upon him in the Nature of Man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 35. <hi>All things are delivered to me of my Father,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25, 27. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. And he hath aſcended up on high, he hath led Captivity Captive, he hath received gifts in the Man, for Men, yea for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 18. To this purpoſe the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks at large, ſaying; <hi>Thou haſt given him his hearts deſire, and haſt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden the requeſt of his lips: for thou preventeſt him with the bleſſings of goodneſs, thou ſetteſt a Crown of pure Gold upon his Head. He asked life of thee, thou gaveſt it him, even length of days for ever and ever: His glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is great in thy ſalvation, Honour and Majeſty haſt thou laid upon him; for thou hast made him moſt bleſſed for ever: thou haſt made him exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad with thy countenance,</hi> Pſ. 21. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>But how can it be ſaid, he is worthy to receive theſe things of the Father, when he had received all theſe things of him before this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As to his receiving them from his Father, it is certa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nly true he had received them all before this time: But yet, he may be
<pb n="918" facs="tcp:48916:404"/>
acknowledged to be worthy to receive them, even to receive what he hath already; not ſo much reſpecting the time as the thing, to wit, his merit and worthineſs: And ſo they ſet to their Seal, as it were, to what God hath done: even as before in this Chapter, 5. the four living Creatures, and twenty-four Elders ſay, <hi>thou art worthy to take the Book,</hi> when he had taken it before, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9. And yet it is thus expreſſed to us.</p>
                  <p>2. But this ſaying alſo may have, and certainly hath reſpect to the Doxology of the Saints and Angels, or to their aſcribing and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring praiſe to the Lamb; and this leads us to the next thing, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. He that was ſlain is worthy to receive theſe excellencies from his Creatures, eſpecially from the Saints and Angels: not that they can add any thing to him really: for in him it hath pleaſed the Father that all fulneſs ſhould dwell: and all things that the Father hath are his, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 14, 15. But they give theſe things to him, when they aſcribe and render to him theſe things, and acknowledge his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and worthineſs, and ſo render his praiſe glorious, as is ſaid before: [ſee Notes on <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 9. and <hi>v.</hi> 11.]</p>
                  <p>3. Upon what account do they acknowledge the Lamb worthy to receive theſe excellencies; And that is, becauſe he was ſlain. Indeed, theſe words <hi>[the Lamb that was ſlain,]</hi> are a deſcription of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom they celebrate, and whoſe praiſe they render glorious: And ſo they direct us to one Perſon; and to one that was, not is, ſlain; to diſtinguiſh him from, and prefer him before all others that may be ſo called, from other Lambs or Perſons ſo called, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 3. for they that were ſlain are ſo ſtill, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 9, 10. But he, this moſt excellent Lamb, is not ſo: He liveth, who was dead, and is alive for evermore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 18. and 2. 8. [See the Notes before on <hi>v.</hi> 6.]</p>
                  <p>But theſe words alſo lead us to the Reaſon wherefore they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Lamb to be worthy to receive all theſe excellent things, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe he was ſlain: And ſo,</p>
                  <p>1. He is worthy to receive, and hath received all from God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the account of his Perſonal abaſement and ſufferings; his blood was ſo precious, it being the blood of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. with <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. The Father loveth the Son, becauſe he laid down his life that he might take it again, that he hath given all things into his hand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 35. with <hi>ch.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>And from all the Saints and holy ones of Mankind, [ſee the Notes before on <hi>v.</hi> 9] And from all the Angels; as here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But why ſhould the Angels thus glorifie him on this account, ſeeing</hi>
                     <pb n="919" facs="tcp:48916:404"/>
                     <hi>he took not their Nature, nor taſted Death for them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe herein God's will was done, and that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in, and glorifie him for: for Chriſt came down from Heaven, not to do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 38. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 20.</p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe it was for our good, that we might be brought to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. They are full of Charity, and that leads Perſons not to ſeek, or rejoice in their own good only, but alſo in that which tends to the good of others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 2, 4, 6. Hence when Chriſt came, and was born into the World the Saviour of Mankind; they rejoice herein, and glorifie God on the account hereof, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 10, 14. and <hi>ch.</hi> 15. 7, 10.</p>

                  <p>1.

                     <pb n="920" facs="tcp:48916:405"/>
                     <hi>whole creation,</hi> or every creature, <hi>groaneth, and travelleth in pain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether untill now. And not only they, but our ſelves alſo, which have the firſt-fruits of the Spirit, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 8. 22, 23. And ſo here, by every creature, we may underſtand, all God's works in all places of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion: All his works diſtinct from the holy Angels, and Saints of mankind, ſee, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 103. 20, 22. with <hi>Pſ.</hi> 145. 10.

                  <p>2.

                  <p>And herein we may have ſome glimpſe of the excellent ſtate and condition the Saints are now in, who are abſent from the body, and preſent with the Lord, even the Spirits of juſt men made perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. and what glory and excellency they ſhall arrive at, when their bodies ſhall be raiſed, and they ſhall compleatly and gloriouſly be Spiritual men<hi>:</hi> then they ſhall be perfect as to attainment, which none are while in mortal bodies, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 11, 12. Now the beſt ſee in part, and know in part: but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part ſhall be done away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8, 9, 12. they ſhall then be equal to the Angels, <hi>Luke</hi> 20, 35, 36. yea they ſhall be like to Chriſt, ſo far as meer creatures are capable.

                  <p>3. The Apoſtle makes a general Repetition of what he had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, ſaying, <hi>[And all that are in them]</hi> not ſome of the Creatures in Heaven, on the Earth, under the Earth, and in the Sea; or ſome of all ſorts: but, <hi>all that are in them:</hi> in which he ſpeaks ſomewhat like to that; <hi>Thou haſt put all things in ſubjection under his feet: for in that he put all in ſubjection under him, be left nothing that is not put under him, Heb.</hi> 2. 6, 8.

2.

So the Devils cried out, ſaying, <hi>What have we to do with thee, Jeſus thou ſon of God,</hi> Mat. 8. 29. And unclean Spirits, when they ſaw Chriſt, fell down before him, and cried, ſaying, <hi>Thou art the Son of God,</hi> Mark 3. 11, 12. And the Legion of Devils, or the Man poſſeſſed therewith, fell down before Jeſus, and with a loud voice ſaid, <hi>What have I to do with thee, Jeſus thou Son of God moſt high? I beſeech thee torment me not,</hi> Luke 8. 27, 32. <hi>And the People were all amazed, inſomuch that they queſtioned among themſelves, ſaying, what thing is this? what new Doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean Spirits, and they obey him,</hi> Mark 1. 24, 27. And ſo we may ſay of wicked Men alſo, for all are his Servants, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 91. They, though not willingly and chearfully, yet, againſt their wills, do after a ſort, not acceptably <hi>(Heb.</hi> 12. 28.) worſhip him, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 25. <hi>They profeſs to know God, who in works deny him, being abominable, and diſobedient, and to every good work reprobate,</hi> Tit. 1. 16. And in due ſeaſon, all ſhall render and aſcribe Bleſſing, and Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto him that ſits upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb: So the Lord ſaith, <hi>I have ſworn by my ſelf, the word is gone out of my Mouth in Righteouſneſs, and ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; that unto me every Knee ſhall bow, every Tongue ſhall ſwear,</hi> Iſay 45. 23. with Rom. 14. 11, 12. And becauſe Chriſt Jeſus humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, the death of the Croſs; therefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name: <hi>That in the name of Jeſus every Knee ſhould bow of things in Heaven, and things on Earth, and things under the Earth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

reckoned amongſt ſuch Creatures as are brute, and have no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; becauſe they ſo degenerate from their Primitive Glory and Excellency; and the latter will not be made clean and renewed. So the Devil is called and compared to the Serpent, <hi>a ſubtle and vile Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 3. Rev. 12. 9, 14, 15. and 20. 2. and Dragon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pſ. 91. 13.

And the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith, to that which he deſired, but believed not, <hi>Amen, the Lord do ſo, the Lord perform the words which thou haſt propheſied, &amp;c. chap.</hi> 28. 5, 7. ſo our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our inſtructs his diſciples in that Doctrine and Rule of right Prayer, to ſay, <hi>for thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, for ever, Amen, Matth.</hi> 6. 13. And ſo <hi>Amen</hi> is as much as an earneſt Prayer, Vote, or Deſire in the Epiſtles generally, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
                  <p>Now here, in that the four Creatures ſay <hi>[Amen]</hi> to what every Creature ſaid, we may learn from hence,</p>
                  <p>1. That the living Creatures alſo heard by Faith, or by the word of faith, what every Creature which is in Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaid: and ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, we may ſee, and hear, in and by the Holy Scriptures, with the Eyes, and Ears of our Soul, what we cannot with our bodily ones, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. and 5. 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. and 11. 27. So we may now, and ought to hear Jeſus Chriſt, who is in Heaven, and ſpeaketh to us from thence, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22, 23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 25. And when the Apoſtle propounds that queſtion; But I ſay, <hi>have they not heard, yes verily</hi> ſaith he: But how proves he that? ſurely, by citing a Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring unto the words, or ſound of the works of Gods Creation and Providence; for it follows, <hi>Their ſound went into all the Earth, and their words unto the ends of the World,</hi> Rom. 10. 18. with Pſal. 19. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>In that the four living Creatures now ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> we may learn, that they do occupy the place of the unlearned<hi>:</hi> for ſo did ſuch as ſaid <hi>Amen,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſignifieth when he ſaith, <hi>How ſhall he that</hi>

                     <hi>occupieth the place of the unlearned ſay</hi> Amen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 16. this was uſually their word, the word of the People as diſtinguiſhed from the Prieſts, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>Deut.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Herein then we may ſee the great humility of the four living Creatures; they do not diſdain to hear, joyn with, and ſay <hi>Amen</hi> unto, that which is good, though it be uttered and ſpoken by ſuch as are greatly below, and very much inferiour to them. It was great Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in <hi>Apollos,</hi> who was an eloquent Man, &amp; mighty in the Scriptures, to receive inſtruction and information from <hi>Aquila,</hi> who was a Tent-maker, and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> his Wife, <hi>Acts.</hi> 18. 24, 25. But it ſeems to be greater in theſe four living Creatures, to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to what the mute and brute Creatures ſay; however it is ſo to learn of ſuch<hi>:</hi> And yet we ſhould not diſdain to receive inſtruction from the loweſt and meaneſt Creatures, <hi>Iſay</hi> 40. 26, 28. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 6, 8, 11. and <hi>ch.</hi> 30. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 7, 8, 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 15, 16, 18, 20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 26, 31.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that here, <hi>every Creature which is in Heaven, and in the Earth, &amp;c.</hi> begins in rendring bleſſing and praiſe; whereto the four living Creatures ſay, <hi>Amen;</hi> we may learn<hi>:</hi> that they are not always the moſt excellent, who begin in rendring his praiſe glorious who ſitteth upon the Throne, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo was noted before. [See the Notes on <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 10.]</p>
                  <p>2. We have alſo an account given us, what was done by the four and twenty Elders: <hi>[And the four and twenty Elders fell down and worſhipped him that liveth for ever and ever.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have ſpoken before to all this latter part of the Verſe<hi>:</hi> unto the acts of their own VVorſhip; and their expreſſion of greater hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility therein, than in the acts of the four living Creatures.
